This is a well-known quote from Desmund Tutu, who was committed to non-violent activism. War is not the answer, yet the Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives and their homes, being violently attacked by Putin. Ukraine is strong, lead by President Zelenskyy, a man who has shown the world what it means to be a leader who loves his people and country. But they still need our help.

WHAT CAN WE DO? We can help UNICEF, who as we speak are on the ground, delivering aid to thousands of children and families whose lives are at stake. (Less than 3% of funds go to admin costs, so you know your donation is going *directly* to those who need our help right now.

Donate now by hitting the first option in my link in bio, which will take you directly to UNICEF's donation page. We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.

I don’t care to get political, nor do I care what any of your political views are…

These are children, humans, innocent people - that are getting bombed and displaced from their homes. I heard the story of a Ukrainian man today that lives here in America, in regards to his friends and family back home. Truly heartbreaking…

Internationally considered an act of aggression, the invasion has triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with more than 4.4 million Ukrainians leaving the country, and a quarter of the population displaced.

Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art (UIMA) partnered with Virtual Concert Halls, a Virginia based internet television producer, to host a global online fundraising effort to benefit UNICEF USA (https://www.unicefusa.org/streaming), who are committed to providing emergency aid to families and children in Ukraine.

On Wednesday, April 13, 2022, Virtual Concert Halls broadcasted a 18-hour live internet stream from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. CT (6 a.m. to 12 midnight ET) from UIMA's headquarters in Chicago, and distributed it to major social media platforms. The event, titled ""Helping UNICEF in Ukraine"", streamed to platforms which included YouTube, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Facebook, and Twitch.

Sir Shefik Macauley, known mononymously as Shefik, is an accomplished industry insider, who has appeared on MTV, SiriusXM, PBS, BET, network television, and in print media, as well as internationally on TRT World (Turkey). He spoke during the event and provided the Voice-Over for a self-produced public service announcement, broadcast around 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET).

UNICEF has been in Ukraine for 25 years — and it is on the ground now, delivering safe water, health and hygiene supplies, blankets, warm clothes, and psycho-social care to children and their families.
