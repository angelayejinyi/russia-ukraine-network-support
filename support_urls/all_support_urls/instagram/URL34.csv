Hello everyone! As many of you know, many devastating things are happening in Ukraine. Everyday we read or hear about women, men, and children that are being mistreated, taken away from their homes, and even killed. War is never the answer. The only war worth waging is for PEACE.

Even if we are a million miles apart, we are all connected. Like a constellation, each one of us shines bright like a star, therething the love we have for each other, creating a force so strong that it becomes unbreakable.¬†

But sometimes our connected path doesn‚Äôt always lead to another brightly shining individual. At times, we meet with people whose light is dimming, fading‚Ä¶ We reach out our hands and offer them kindness, so that when our love transfers to them, they‚Äôll reach out for another, creating a constellation of hope, to all that reach for it. We are all one, and when we combine our humanity, we can make astronomical changes in this world.

We have decided to run a charity auction with our HUGE Monstera Thai Constellation as a symbol of connection and hope where 100% of proceeds will go to the people of Ukraine. We have chosen @projecthopeorg (www.projecthope.org) where they are actively responding to the Ukraine crisis and shipping essential  medicines and medical supplies to assist Ukrainians. Please consider bidding on this beautiful plant that will always remind you of the love, strength, and the hope you brought to hundreds, if not thousands of people.¬†

Bidding will start at $400 with increments of $25. Please comment with your bid!
This fundraiser LOCAL ONLY, as this our Thai Constellation is a tad too big to ship out! If you have any questions regarding this charity auction, please DM us and we will quickly and happily answer you! ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá¶‚úåÔ∏è#ukraine #istandwithukraine #thaiconstellation #monstera #fundraiser #charity",https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca2fc9Guagp/,www.projecthope.org,www.projecthope.org,projecthope
