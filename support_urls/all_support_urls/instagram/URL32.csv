Over the last eight years, war has been steadily waged in Ukraine, leaving more than 850,000 people internally displaced and almost 3 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The economy was already in decline due to the conflict and the impacts of COVID-19. 

The escalation of violence between Russia and Ukraine has already resulted in senseless death and will lead to ongoing grave human suffering if allowed to continue. The world is now witnessing death, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and massive displacement.
 
The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is launching an emergency appeal to help support displaced families with critical aid.
 
As a call to action NOW, we would ask you to donate to global organizations like the IRC supporting the people of Ukraine. To make it easier for you to donate we are offering a 20% Discount via our web store on all our products when you use PROMO CODE: KYIV20.
 
The savings you gain from Halfbreed Blades we ask that you donate to show your support for the men, women, and children of Ukraine.
 
This special discount will run until Monday 7th March 2022. 
Further announcements will be made as the situation in Europe develops.

In Poland there are thousands of people that are helping war refugees. The whole country is on its feet trying to organize the new reality for them. Housing facilities, food, medicine. Lawyers offering help with crossing the border. Doctors supporting old and young. Therapists. Artists. The empathy at its best. I am overwhelmed and proud with the magnitude of help from my fellow citizens.

While I don’t typically use this platform for anything that’s not book related, I couldn’t let another day go by without reacting to the humanitarian crisis currently happening in Ukraine. 

This is not a political issue, it’s a matter of human rights, and I wanted to do something to raise awareness and show support. For every blue and yellow bookstack with the hashtag #bookstasupportsukraine I will donate $5 (up to $500) to the International Rescue Committee(IRC) to provide critical aid to Ukrainian displaced citizens.

In case you missed it, here is a word from Artistic Director Diana Byer:

“My four grandparents were born in the Ukraine, and I cannot express how proud and in awe I am of how the people of Ukraine have resisted the invasion by Russia. From the small group of soldiers on Snake Island in the face of a warship; to the men and women – civilians – staying to fight and defend their country while their children harbor in neighboring countries; to Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s comedian turned president and Russia’s #1 target, who refused America’s evacuation offer saying, “I need ammunition, not a ride.”
 
I am also proud of how many countries and organizations around the world have quickly unified to say, “This is wrong and dangerous. We cannot allow this to happen.”
 
My message comes from the novel Room by Emma Donoghue: “Scared is what you’re feeling. Brave is what you’re doing.” To that end, I am collecting funds tonight that will go directly to International Rescue Committee to help the displaced families from this war in Ukraine. I hope you will join me.”

Our girl is named in honor of the heroic young woman killed attempting to get food to shelter dogs in the Ukraine. 

This once neglected, unwanted shelter girl is safe with us tonight. Life hasn’t been kind to this little girl but we’re working hard to make up for it. She’s likely a whippet or whippet mix and very sweet. Her appetite is good and she’ll be on a careful refeeding program of small bland meals as her body adjusts to processing nutrients again. Rapid refeeding can be fatal to starved dogs so it has to be done carefully. Anastasia is a skeletal 30 pounds and needs to gain around 8-10 pounds to reach healthy weight. 

Making a difference one animal at a time.

With the recent invasion of Ukraine, our team has been on the ground at the border assessing and supporting children at high risk for exploitation. 

O.U.R.’s mission is to end human trafficking through prevention, direct intervention, and aftercare support. In line with our mission, our team is looking into ways we can support at-risk individuals in Ukraine both short term and long term. ⁠As of now, we have two fundraisers that will go directly towards helping at-risk individuals affected by the crisis in Ukraine: 

1. Help take care of several at-risk foster children living in Ukraine 
We are very familiar with a group in Ukraine that takes care of several foster children at a time. These kids are in need of immediate assistance. Our goal is to raise $15,000 to keep them fed and provide for other basic needs. 

2. Build a safe place for at-risk orphans and survivors of exploitation 
We are working with a trustworthy aftercare group in Romania to remodel their aftercare home and finish building a second home. They already take care of several survivors of exploitation and trafficking. Soon, several at-risk children from an orphanage in Ukraine will be legally brought over. Your donations will allow these renovations and building plans to take place, enable this aftercare group to take care of current survivors, and continue to take in at-risk children and provide long term care. 

We thank you for continuing to support the mission of fighting against human trafficking. Learn more about these fundraisers at ourrescue.org/fillaneed (link in bio).",https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbGoFmgLn2t/,ourrescue.org/fillaneed,ourrescue.org/fillaneed,ourrescue

Angelina* is one of the now over 3.4 million people who have fled Ukraine into neighboring countries such as Poland—people who simply want peace and safety for their children. This is her message to the world.

At the IRC, we’re doing everything we can to support those who have been forcibly displaced by the crisis in Ukraine.
