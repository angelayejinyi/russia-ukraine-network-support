For many years, Eccho Rights has enjoyed wonderful and fruitful relationships with partners in Ukraine and we are devastated by what has unfolded over the past week, with our thoughts going out to our close friends in Kyiv who find themselves under vicious attack.

As international distributors of Servant of the People, the series created by and starring President Zelenskiy, it is Eccho Rights' position that the best support the global television industry can offer to Ukraine today is to share this story.

The series is a comedy but also an important document of where Zelenskiy comes from. His fictional president is a normal man, who grows into his role as a heroic and adored leader. While the real world scenario facing Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people is far more grim and appalling than the comedy of the series, there are obvious parallels with the real world situation, and Servant of the People is a fascinating, important and historic piece of television. A number of major broadcasters have already agreed licenses for the series in the past week, including Channel 4 in the UK, MBC in the Middle East, ANT 1 in Greece and PRO TV in Romania.

Three seasons of the series, as well as a feature film are all available to license from Eccho Rights. For more information on the series, please visit our website.

To support our friends, colleagues and their compatriots in Ukraine, Eccho Rights is pledging a donation of ‚Ç¨50 000 to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, who are in desperate need of help to assist victims of the war. For more information and to make your own contributions go to https://redcross.org.ua/en/

Finally, Eccho Rights has removed all Russian-owned and produced series from our catalogue with immediate effect. In solidarity with Ukraine, we must take every punitive measure available to us in the fight against Russia.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CamngFUt5Ye/,https://redcross.org.ua/en/,redcross.org.ua,redcross

The website of Ukrainian Red Cross has resumed its work.  https://redcross.org.ua/ works as usual.

 Yesterday around 14:00 the official site of Ukrainian Red Cross Society suffered cyber attacks.  Its work was completely suspended for hours.  No personal data of the beneficiaries was stored on the site and, therefore, was not affected.

üá∫üá¶ Ever since the start of the war in Ukraine, I have asked myself what I can do to help. Together with graphic designer Olga, who assists my small dance business, we created the artwork ‚ÄúPrayer‚Äù. I decided to donate a canvas artwork of Prayer for a fundraiser for Ukrainians in need, but it still seemed like such a small thing to do. So I reached out to other dance brands to find out if they would be interested in joining us and the response was incredible! Fifteen companies responded, offering to sponsor prizes for our fundraiser.
¬†
We now have enough prizes for 2 grand prizes with a total value of over $900 USD!! 100% of the proceeds from this fundraiser will be donated to the Ukrainian Red Cross, to assist Ukrainians in desperate need and provide life-saving supplies:¬†https://redcross.org.ua/en/

- Providing food, first aid, clean water, shelter support, warm clothing, hygiene parcels and medicines

Civilian deaths are increasing on a daily basis across the country with no sign of stopping, with thousands of innocent people already killed and millions forced out of their homes in search of refuge. We cannot leave this unchecked, and we need to act on this now without hesitation.

Now more than ever is a time for unity, solidarity and support of Ukraine. It's crucial for us to use our voice to create widespread and sustained awareness of the situation on the ground, and to give support in every way possible.

We are inviting the Drum & Bass community to come together in support of Ukraine on April 15th (Good Friday) at Studio 338 for an all-day event, with all proceeds donated to two organisations providing crucial humanitarian support right now to those in need: The Ukrainian Red Cross Society, and the Music Saves UA fund. Please see below for links to full information on the two chosen organisations, which will each receive 50% of the total proceeds.

Our line up will include a huge selection of artists from across the spectrum of D&B, and will be announced soon. We have already seen the power of the D&B community through the success of the compilation album 'Together with Ukraine', which has raised over ¬£85,000 in under 2 weeks and features over 130 exclusive tracks.

Every act of support - no matter how small - makes a positive impact. Join us for what will be an unmissable event for a great cause. 

Please consider donating more than the ticket price, if you have the means to do so.

Marcus Kaye died on the 28th of May 2017 aged 45. As Marcus Intalex he was an undeniable force in the In the world of drum and bass and latterly¬†he commanded equal respect for his Techno and electro productions as Trevino.¬†I was lucky enough to release some of his finest work on The Nothing Special. I enjoyed every interaction with him, most of which were phone calls from a golf course. He loved Golf, The name Trevino adopted in tribute to Spanish golfer Lee Trevino. His own label was called Birdie, a word used to being a stroke under par. He was an incredibly prolific producer which allowed me to cherry pick from¬†large quantities of tunes so well produced they barely needed mastering. Just before his departure from this world to the next I had dinner with him in Manchester before a gig. He was a dry, well informed and funny man who was a pleasure to be with. His sudden death sent a ripple of sadness through our community. Reminding us all that life may not last as long as we imagine it to. His spirit will always shine with significance, The legacy of his music will never end. Backtracking was one of his finest creations and a defining track for the label. Somewhere back there I asked Calibre, a close friend and contemporary of Marcus if he would consider reworking it. The result is a wonderful new interpretation of a special tune which we proudly present in his honour.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CbsiSQZA110/,https://redcross.org.ua,redcross.org.ua,redcross
