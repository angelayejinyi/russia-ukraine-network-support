You can help him here (link also in story):
https://fundly.com/first-aid-kits-for-ukraine-4

Here is what he has to say about his effort: 

""I recently posted that I wanted to fight to defend Ukraine. It has proven difficult to find a position that will leverage my skills in-country.

Seeing so many Ukrainian families dying, injured, and fleeing their homes has me thinking about battlefield first aid.

I am trying to raise funds to purchase IFAK medical first aid bags/kits. Once I am able to procure enough, I will personally escort the kits to the border (there are stories that not all supplies are reaching the border before an intermediary up charges for profit). I have contacts at the border that will receive the kits.

Part of the plan is to bring a former combat medic with me to give a short training on how to use the kit.

Please forward (DM or post) any leads on bulk tactical first aid kits, and contents for the kits; and contacts that may want to donate funds for purchasing the kits and travel for the medic.

May we all take inspiration from the brave resistance being shown by the Ukrainian people.""

Hello my beautiful blossoms..... it has been queit a few months since I've posted. Hope everyone is doing well. 
I'm sure you have all heard what has been happening in the world: my homeland, Ukraine was viciously attacked by the Russian federation. 
This had deeply affected me personally. My heart is breaking for all the men, women, and children of Ukraine who are suffering through this hideous war. 
I am having a fundraiser to help the Ukrainian people win. Please read my story on @fundly and if you can, donate and share. 
It would mean the world to us to be able to get this money together for specific items we were asked to get. 
XO
