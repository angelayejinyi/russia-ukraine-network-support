Dear American Friends, Employees and Employers, Business Owners, Investors and Philanthropist. I want to draw your attention to what‚Äôs happening in Europe right now, the War that Russia has started in Ukraine. Millions of people‚Äôs lives stopped the moment the invasion happened. All big cities are under attack at this moment. Schools, hospitals, residential areas getting bombed every single day. This Putin regime doesn't feel sorry for anyone. We must stop it now, and do it together! In 1994 the US, UK, Ukraine and Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum that grants sovereignty of every country and from any country. Russia started this war despite all the world known guarantees, and now the US, UK and all other developed countries must act. Otherwise, it all will lead to World War III. Let‚Äôs not this allow to happen. Everyone can help! Here are the official volunteering organizations where you can donate what you can. Every cent is appreciated and will save someone‚Äôs life. If you have other options to help (like medical supplies, military stuff, home goods for refugees etc), let me know I‚Äôll be happy to coordinate (+1 773 827 2372 - Dima). ‚ÄúOne person cannot change the entire world, but that same person can change the entire world for one person.‚Äù
