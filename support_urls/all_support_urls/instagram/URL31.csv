Our hearts hurt for the people of Ukraine. We are saddened by the events of the past 24 hours and as they continue to unfold.

Everyday citizens just like you and me are being displaced, living in fear, and unjustifiably hurt by their neighbors.

While most of our team sits a continent away, we find it important to help from afar however we can.

We don't wish to gain whatsoever from the situation with a % of sales being donated, or something similar, so we wanted to share the link to a credible charity that could certainly use some donations at this time called GlobalGiving.

GlobalGiving is one of the top-rated charities on Charity Navigator which means that a 3rd party has verified a large % of donations truly make it out to the field and efforts. That means optimal impact.

Right now they have a project called the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund that is raising money. Here is a blurb of what your donations will be used for from their site:

""All donations to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund will support humanitarian assistance in impacted communities in Ukraine and surrounding regions where Ukrainian refugees have fled. GlobalGiving's local partners in Ukraine are bringing relief to displaced families and people in high-risk areas, and they need resources to continue and expand their vital work.""

If you find yourself in a position to help, please use this link (also in our bio for the few couple days) to donate:

In such situations, women and girls are at heightened risk of sexual and gender based violence.

Pramila Patten, UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict said in a statement that ‚ÄúUnless the conflict ceases, thousands of additional families will be forcibly displaced, dramatically escalating the scale of the already dire humanitarian situation, and increasing the risk of sexual violence and exploitation.""

The statement further called on these factors to be taken into consideration when early warning signs of impact are observed so that an appropriate and proportionate response can be formulated well in time. UN Women also called on women's full and meaningful participation as vital in improving peace and security processes. In this regard, they recognized the civil society organizations on the ground who are critical partners in the work to amplify the voices of women and girls. The inclusion of women themselves in the decision-making processes and humanitarian response is therefore essential to ensure that their rights are upheld.

You can help the women and girls in Ukraine in the following ways:

- Amplify their voices online and offline.
- Share verified sources for help and aid.
- Donate to protect through the UN Women Donation: https://donate.unwomen.org/en/ukraine
- Donate to UNICEF‚Äôs work with children in Ukraine: https://help.unicef.org/ukraine-emergency
- Donate to Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund by Global Giving: https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/ukraine-crisis-relief-fund/
- Donate through The International Committee of the Red Cross to improve living conditions for displaced people in Ukraine: https://www.icrc.org/en/donate/ukraine

Let's do all we can towards the relief work being done in Ukraine, to minimize atrocities against citizens, especially women and young girls.

Sunflowers represent happiness, optimism, honesty, longevity, peace, and devotion. The sunflower possibly surpasses all other flowers in terms of its universal power to bring joy to people. If you've ever seen a field of sunflowers growing you know how incredibly joyful it can feel to be filled by their powerful presence and beauty.

The sunflower is also the national flower of Ukraine. In wishing peace and protection for the people of Ukraine, and wanting to help, I've decided to offer this pin as a fundraiser for the month of March. 50% of all proceeds from the purchase of one of these pins will go to Global Giving Org. They believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of conflicts like these, and I agree. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future challenges.

‚òÄÔ∏è You will be able to purchase this as a download, A4, or A3 sized print. ‚Å†

It‚Äôs horrifying, seeing these images and hearing the interviews full of complete despair, of people fleeing and fighting for their lives and the lives of their families.

This beer was brewed with Amarillo, Belma, and Strata hops and Idaho 7 cryo and is ultra-fruit-forward, lightly sweet and beautifully bright.

PSA: We feel that we must state (after receiving much feedback on our last post about the release) that by standing with and supporting Ukraine, we are not saying that we don‚Äôt feel pain for the innocent, desperate people in Russia, and for all of the many, MANY suffering people in our own community and around the world. üíî Our Complicated Discourse on Tuesday is the topic US Interventionism in Ukraine and Around the World, and we would really enjoy talking with you all in person at 7pm on March 29th.

Come by anytime between noon and 11pm to support Ukraine, as long as supplies last. *Donations from beer sales will continue to benefit Global Giving until beer is sold out.

Somewhere in Italy, a young woman rushes on a date to a restaurant.

 In Poland, a little girl braids her favorite doll's hair and sings a song to her.

 In France, a man in an elegant suit chooses a necklace for his wife.

 In Australia, children play on the carpet and wait for their mother to bake a cake.

 In America, a woman cannot decide on a name for her newborn son.

 In a respectable age in Germany, a man walks in a park and listens to birds sing.

 At the same time ...Here. In Ukraine. War. Here. In Ukraine. Genocide.

Elderly people are bullied here. Men are being tortured. Shoot in the back of the head. Women are raped in front of children. Children are raped. They kill.

Here. In Ukraine. In 2022, people are buried in mass graves. Buried in the yards. Near the entrances. Or they just leave the bodies on the streets because there is no one to bury them. Here. In Ukraine. Here. In Ukraine. Destroy the population of cities. Clean up. Equalize settlements with land. They leave fires behind.

 At the same time

talk about us to the world. Russia is committing genocide against the Ukrainian people. pray for us and for peace in our lands.
