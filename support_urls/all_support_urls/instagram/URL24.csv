Have we figured it out? No, not really. But the thing that we keep coming back to is that there is no brand without the people behind it. Fort Point was created by people who have an undying love for San Francisco. I’m one of them. 👋 I’m Dina, one of the owners of Fort Point. I’ve been lucky enough to live in SF longer than any other city in my life, but I’m not “from here.” I’m an immigrant from the former Soviet Union. My parents and I came to the U.S. as refugees from Belarus. I still have family there, and in Ukraine and in Russia. Putin’s horrific and unjustifiable war on Ukraine is a new reality that was almost impossible to fathom even a week ago, but it is here.

As many of you, I have been feeling upset and helpless with the current situation, and I have found that my sanctuary has been my kitchen. The history, culture and stories behind food is a universal constant that has always brought people together, lifted spirits and raised awareness.

 A traditional favorite for generations, many Ukrainians have warm, fond memories of this dish from childhood. Today for Pasta Thursday I wanted to  #cookforukraine with this beloved comforting Halushki by @momsdish - a dumpling dish with scrumptious bacon, sautéed mushrooms & onions - one of Natalya’s grandmother’s recipes. We are told that it is Ukraine’s version of gnocchi and, like gnocchi, the dumplings can be prepared with different sauces and tossed with a variety of veggies, proteins and toppings. 

These flour-based dumplings are easy to make. Flour, salt, eggs, water and melted butter are combined and fashioned into a ball in a bowl, divided into 8 pieces and rolled into thin logs. (Swipe ➡️ to see process) Each log is cut into small dumplings and boiled in salted water until they float. 

In a separate pan, mushrooms, onions and bacon are sautéed and seasoned until tender. I tossed in chopped zucchini and sweet peas for added veggies & color. Next the dumplings and veggie mixture are added to a skillet and pan-fried until dumplings are golden, with reserved dumpling water added to loosen things up.

Served with a sprinkling of scallions & crunchy garlic bread. A fresh salad would also accompany this dish nicely.

MEET artistic duo @hi.webad from Kyiv. See their powerful art and crucial words – and #StandWithUkraine. 

“On February 24, Russia started a war against Ukraine! By air, land, and sea, Putin has launched a devastating attack on Ukraine, a peaceful European democratic country! He is the true evil, he wants to destroy the whole country and its people. Children, the elderly, and families are dying. People are losing their homes and have to escape. 

We can’t describe to you what war is, because you can never understand it while living in peace. It was the same for us, before it actually happened. We lived in our lovely native land, hung out with friends, made plans, traveled, had family dinners and dreamed. And everything changed in one morning. 

War is when you call your friends and family 5 times a day , to make sure they are still alive. When you hold your phone literally the whole day, reading the news because of the fear of missing something important. Sitting in silence, so you can hear the city emergency siren and have enough time to run in a shelter before the next bomb attack. War is when it seems that every unexpected sound is a danger. When you don’t know what tomorrow will be.

Over this time we once again realize how much we love our country and its people. We keep together, fight together against the enemy, and help each other no matter what. We are very proud of our army. These guys are making unbelievable efforts to protect us!

But we still can not stop this war alone, we need the world’s support.

So please, #StandWithUkraine!

Protest, post, tell your friends and families what is going on here, do not buy Russian products, ask your government to close the sky over Ukraine.

It can save our lives.”

Right now it is very important that we:
1. Educate ourselves, talk about what is going on, share information and make social media posts. DON’T STAY SILENT AND IGNORE THE REALITY! USE THE POWER OF YOUR VOICE!
2. Donate what you can. If you don’t have the money to donate- get crafty and do a fundraiser! Make items that symbolize support for Ukraine and sell them advertised as donations for Ukraine! Ideas: anything blue and yellow & homemade.
3. Sign petitions. 
4. Give unwavering support to Ukrainian Artists, Brands, Companies. Shop from Ukrainians on amazon, etsy, Instagram- whenever you can find Ukrainians to support don’t hesitate!
5. Truly learn about Ukrainian Culture & History. 
There are many more ways than just this to help out. It is so crucial that we acknowledge what is happening to Ukraine and her people and do whatever we can in our own ways to help, even if it’s just by sharing some links and showing that you Stand With Ukraine.

In the last weeks, we’ve been featuring Ukrainian artists from our community and their powerful messages to the world. See Elzara’s harrowing art and moving story – and #StandWithUkraine.

“My name is Elzara, I am a Ukrainian artist from Kyiv.
I lived in Crimea and moved to Kyiv immediately after the occupation of Crimea by Russia in 2014.

As it turned out, I have suffered from Russia all my life, starting with my great-grandparents.

I am a Crimean Tatar who was born not where I should have been. As the daughter of a deported people, I was born in Russia. But I spent my childhood with stories and dreams of my relatives, about Crimea, and about how one day we would return to our native land.
Every summer, my grandfather and our whole family tried to come to Crimea, where we finally managed to get a tiny piece of land, somewhere very far from civilization. Every year during the summer, my grandfather worked on building a house – he laid every brick with his own hands.

In 2000, my parents and I moved on to Crimea. It was very difficult. I was a teenager, and the change of life was quite destructive at this age.

In Crimea I faced discrimination in my native land! We lived 14 difficult but happy years. Until the Russians came.

This time I moved only with my husband. It was just the two of us. We had no relatives or acquaintances. But there was a great desire to work, create, build. And we succeeded.

But then they came again.

They destroyed my home, which I had dreamed of all my life. My own home, which we could not buy for so many years! They destroyed everything in the suburb of Irpin, where I lived for the last 5 years. Russians destroyed everything here, like in other cities of my native and beloved country.”
