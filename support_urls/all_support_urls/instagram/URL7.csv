We have finally launched our Humanitarian project for Ukrainian families on Kickstarter 🤗🇺🇦

Over the past months, Russian occupiers have created real horror on the territory of Ukraine, and now it is so important to remain not indifferent and support the suffering people in every possible way✊. Therefore, Goodevas joined the general flow of aid, creating his own Kickstarter humanitarian project to help fellow countrymen, thanks to which now everyone will have the opportunity to help the victims by supporting the project and paying for one of the aid kits🎒!! 

Each Goodevas Aid Kits is filled with everything necessary for Ukrainian families in need❤️, from food to hygiene products. All together there are 4 types:

👶 Kids Kit
👩‍👦 Kids + Moms Kit (2in1)
👨‍👩‍👧 Extra Family Kit (3in1)
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Extra Big Pack Family (5in1)

+ we add personal label to kits, so Ukrainians will know who was their savior👌
