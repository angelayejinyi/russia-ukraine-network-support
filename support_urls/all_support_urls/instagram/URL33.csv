We‚Äôve been deeply affected and saddened by the violence and destruction happening in Ukraine right now and wanted to use the TGN platform to make any difference we can. So we‚Äôve decided to host an auction, with all proceeds going directly to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC (@icrc) is doing important work in Ukraine, and for the thousands of refugees fleeing the war.

This is a great opportunity to contribute to a great cause while also scoring an AMAZING selection of gear that we‚Äôve pulled together with the help of a number of contributing listeners and brands. It‚Äôs a kit chock-full of gear squarely in the TGN wheelhouse‚Äîreading material, travel goods, sartorial accessories, a killer clock, and an awesome watch. See the full list below.
Here‚Äôs how it works: The auction is open now. Bid on the whole package by adding a comment on this post. You can increase bids in any increment and bid as often as you like. The auction ends at 10pm Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday, March 23rd.
The winner must donate to ICRC directly (https://www.icrc.org/en/donate/ukraine) and then send us a receipt as proof of the payment. We will try to ship off the package by the 29th of March. The auction is open to anyone that lives where FedEx will deliver, but you're on the hook for any local taxes or import duties. The package will be sent from the US. Good luck and thanks for your support!",https://www.instagram.com/p/CbM89d1LIKB/,https://www.icrc.org/en/donate/ukraine,www.icrc.org,icrc

I usually don't speak about this, because I consider that music is music, but not only as a citizen but more a human being in this world, I need to speak and try to do something on my position. This song delivers a simple message : ""stop the war !"".

I have no words to describe what is happening right now in Europe (and more generally in the world), feeling that I can't do nothing, so maybe that this song can spread a bit the message (I already know if you listen to this genre of music, you might already know), for those who can't have access to it, after the closing of social medias in Russia.

I needed to speak out, to do the little I can do on my side, to use the little power of communication that I have to share this. People in Russia, I know it is easier to write it than doing there, but please, rise against your government, they can't control you all, show it to them, that this is over. Don't let the future teaching you, your future children, and your country that in moments when you were told the truth, you looked in another direction. The whole world is rising against this, join us.

For people who want to help Ukrainian refugees or civilians in Ukraine, don't hesitate to support with money (even 10 euros is a lot, if 1000 people do it, it is 10 000 euros at the end) with international, european and national GNO (like for example : www.icrc.org/). But even closer to you, support local associations by bringing them some food, some clothes, some time and some humanity.

Help how much you can help, never make a ranking about who should deserve more than others. Everybody deserves to live in peace.

Thanks a lot if you have been reading this until here. We are together, let's not let them trying to confront us, we have 3 words ""stop the war"", because none of us want.

About the International Red Cross in Ukraine‚Å†
‚Å†
The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014. Their operations in the country are among the ten largest ICRC operations worldwide with a team of over 600 staff members. Working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, they are increasing their response to the humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Their support to people includes emergency assistance such as food, water, and other essential items. They also support hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment and emergency preparedness. They repair water stations and support households to rehabilitate their damaged homes. They also help families separated by the conflict reconnect.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CbPx1RPORwP/,https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/europe-central-asia/ukraine,www.icrc.org,icrc

The concert features arias and ensemble pieces from Romantic opera as well as instrumental music for violin and piano, performed by professional musicians from Ukraine and other nations: pianist Alexander Chaplinskiy; sopranos Zoya Gramagin and Sara Pearson; mezzo-sopranos Eugenia Forteza, Ema Mitroviƒá, and Galina Ivannikova; bass-baritone Jonathan R. Green; and the instrumental duet of Yulia Basis and Andy Didorenko. Works by an array of composers will be featured, including Ukrainian and Russian works. ""We stand with Ukrainians and with those brave Russians who dare speak up against the invasion and protest in the streets or media,‚Äù says Natalie Burutskaya, producer and artist manager with the company. Tickets (from $40) can be purchased in advance at Eventbrite.com @eventbrite and payment can also be made at the door (though this concert is likely to sell out). All advance ticket sales guarantee admission but a $100 ticket purchased in advance secures you a reserved seat. The concert is in-person only and not webcast. You must be fully vaccinated to attend and face-coverings must be worn. 

All proceeds will go to Benice LLC (Asnova Holding) in Kyiv. This company organizes help to those who are left homeless after bombing and who (especially those with children) need to be evacuated from their places and given a roof and food immediately. This provides very targeted help exactly where it is needed through an organization known to and trusted by Natalie Burutskaya and the producers of the concert.

If you cannot attend this concert but would like to help the Ukrainian people at this time, there are, of course, very, very many worthy charities one can give to. Here are four:
