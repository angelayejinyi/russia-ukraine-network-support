In support of the Ukrainian people, I will release a new song called “Before The Tide” next friday - March 4th -  via @bandcamp. 
 Since Bandcamp is waiving all of their fees on that day, I want to try to collect as much money as possible which then will go directly to humanitarian funds. I will not keep any money that I am making with this song.   So if you enjoy my music, please consider purchasing “Before The Tide” so that, collectively, we can show solidarity and support to a country that is facing a horrible war lead by Putin.  
I hope, this song gives anyone who hears it strength in these devastating times and the courage to face what lies ahead. Never give up <3
 Further, please consider what you can do to support Ukraine.  For more information, check these links:   https://standwithukraine.live/how-to-help/

HerrMess is a DJ based in Kyiv and co-founder of Door909. His interest in DJing emerged after attending the party series ""Technologiya"", where he was inspired by the likes of Sasha Zlykh, Nastya Muravyova and Yana Woodstock.

Since then, he began to develop his style into more darker and industrial elements of electronic music. HerrMess's finally made his debut back in 2019 playing on the line-up of White Rave, followed by performances at such events as Evolution Rave, Sweetanok, Synthetica, Kanvas. 

HerrMess's sets aim to hypnotise with a dark, and sometimes aggressive, sound accompanied with rhythmic industrial grooves.

Having a heavy heart for the people of Ukraine I decided to dedicate this upcoming liveset to them, and all the proceeds raised will go to the Kyiv Independent, a group of independent journalists working hard to get credible news out of Ukraine, via their gofundme page: www.gofundme.com/f/kyivindependent-launch

I've been working on the set on and off for about 3 months now, having got my new set up working well for partly improvised and partly prepared electro/techno/jazz workouts.

This will be my first extensive solo public performance of a live electronic set of music since September 2019 when I supported Neil Landstrumm at The Grand Social.

That night is also the release date of Looking In The Rain feat. @dorota_konchevska, livestream attendees will receive the track via bandcamp 😁😊✊👊

Thank you to @aardrijkskunde and @1granary for calling attention to the fashion industry's reach and the importance of being vocal. 

What is happening in Ukraine is horrifying. The suffering and displacement of ordinary people should never be accepted. We are sharing a list of resources put together by @trippin.world that support some of Ukraine's marginalised communities, which we have donated to. More resources in the first comment. 

It has also brought to light that occupations of other parts of the world are not offered the same attention. We must ensure that moving forward, we extend the same degree of solidarity to all those suffering from military invasion—particularly those from marginalised groups who are still discriminated against even during crisis.

How can we help? Donate. Amplify. Protest. 

Please remember that the actions of the Russian State and Putin do not reflect the people of Russia.

I feel we are not lonely we are not forgotten.” 32-year-old Stepan Rogulskyi tells us he keeps his doors open at his deli and market with a heavy heart.  He gets little sleep worrying about his uncles, brothers, and sisters who are still in Ukraine.  It’s his love for his community and their support that keeps him going right now.  With every order and every phone call—he feels the love! 

Rogulskyi immigrated to the U-S in 2008 and opened up this deli last year during the pandemic.  It’s called the Varenyk house on fresh pond road.  Rogulskyi’s mother, father, and brothers live in western Ukraine.  He calls them several times every day. @varenykhouse 

Initially , he wanted to go and fight in the Ukraine—Rogulskyi decided to stay with his family in Queens.  You can feel his anxiety.  Keeping busy and working he says saves him. 

Most of his customers lately are perfect strangers and first time customers who just want to show him they care. He sells special Ukrainian pierogis now to help raise funds.  They are yellow and blue and delicious! 

A special thanks to @qns_together for telling us about this fabulous small business. @pix11news #monicamakesithappen

“As the military invasion in Ukraine escalates, millions of people are facing a serious humanitarian crisis and are in need of urgent assistance. 

Together, we can support communities impacted by this devastating violence and the regions open to helping displaced people. 

All donations raised will be distributed to verified nonprofit organizations supporting vulnerable communities to obtain access to shelter, food, medical services, education, and psychosocial support, as well as other people impacted.

We are collaborating with a number of partners including the US Department of State and Global Giving to identify organizations that are providing effective relief now to those impacted.”

A native of Kiev, Ukraine, Olga is one of the pioneers of a manual fanning technique that has changed the lash industry forever. Olga and a few of her colleagues soon realized that manually gathering, fanning and placing several lashes onto each individual lash resulted in a lush, luxe effect unparalleled in the industry, pushing past classic lash extension application. She named her new technique “Hollywood Volume.” Russian lash artists began practicing and teaching this new approach around the globe - and the now-legendary ""Russian Volume"" method was born...by a Ukrainian lash innovator.

Olga is the founder of Vivienne lash extensions, Editor in Chief of Lashmaker, and a highly sought out speaker and judge for lash and brow events worldwide. In 2019, she was granted a Green Card for her contributions to our industry. Olga currently lives in southern California with her young daughter.

Vivienne Lash headquarters are currently under bombardment in Kiev, its employees have scattered, fleeing this unprovoked, deadly war devastating Ukraine. And so are other lash artists in Ukraine, women with their children, just like you.

Olga is working on getting funds to verified, vetted lash artists and her team as they try to find safety with their families. Please help us get some much needed money to these women affected by this terrible circumstance.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/lash-sisters-helping-ukraines-lash-artists (link in bio)

Olga will transfer these donations from her business accounts in Ukraine directly to the recipient's credit cards/functioning bank accounts.

Any amount helps, sincerely.
Even $5 can provide a meal for someone who has had to walk away from everything to survive.

If you make your living as a lash artist, love lashes or can help women fleeing this unprovoked war, please help us help them.

Thank you so much!",https://www.instagram.com/p/CbF3gAZrE7p/,https://www.gofundme.com/f/lash-sisters-helping-ukraines-lash-artists,www.gofundme.com,gofundme

La mia inflessibile determinazione a dire NO A TUTTE LE GUERRE è frutto di una profonda consapevolezza delle nefaste conseguenze (purtroppo anche a lungo termine) che la guerra produce nelle persone, in una comunità e in un Paese. 

Spesso non basta una vita intera per ricostruire i cuori, le anime, le menti e un’umanità sventrata da una guerra che crea una interminabile catena di odio e di rancore che continua ad alimentare il conflitto che li ha generati. 

Lo spirito bellicoso, insidiosamente insinuato nella nostra comunità umana, cerca purtroppo di convincere le nostre coscienze che non esiste un’alternativa alla guerra o che la Pace può essere solo raggiunta tramite le armi.

Oggi, la nostra comunità umana necessita di donne e di uomini, Eroi dell’Umanità, che si alzano generosamente per mettersi al servizio della PACE. 

Oggi, la nostra comunità umana necessita di donne e di uomini, Partigiani della Pace, che conducono la loro lotta su un alto piano morale al fine di realizzare le sublime promesse della  democrazia.

Oggi, la nostra comunità umana abbisogna di donne e di uomini, Ambasciatori della Libertà, che rifiutano di soddisfare la propria sete di Pace bevendo dalla velenosa coppa dell’odio e del risentimento.

Domenica 20 marzo in Piazza San Giovanni (Roma) alle 15.00 innalziamo insieme un inno per la Pace, avviando un movimento dei Partigiani della Pace convinti a resistere allo spirito della guerra in tutte le sue manifestazioni.

Troverete di seguito una raccolta fondi destinata a coprire le spese vive della manifestazione e a sostenere @resqpeople e @mediterranearescue, due importantissime organizzazioni che salvano le vite di chi scappa dalle guerre👇🏿👇

8 рік я борюся за повноцінне життя свого сина і думала що це найстрашніше наше випробування, але нажаль прийшла війна, яка стала ще більш тяжким випробуванням....

Наша сторінка стала щоденником життя синочка і щороку я залишаю тут фото з результатом зростання Сашка на лікуванні 💉

На жаль цього року фотографія не поруч з нашим рідним ростоміром у зв'язку з війною і нам довелося покинути свій будинок..

За цей рік Сашко підріс на 5 см завдяки підтримці кожного з вас. 🙏

Дякуємо усім за внесок у ці 146 см 🙆‍♂️❤️

Я бачу, як ви намагаєтеся, допомагаєте хто чим може, хто бере участь у фінансовій допомозі на препарати, хто робить репости та поширює нашу історію, а хто морально підтримує мене, що дає сили боротися далі та не опускати руки. 💪

Велике ДЯКУЮ нашим чарівникам за підтримку!

Люблю! Ціную! Міцно обіймаю кожного і кажу багато разів ДЯКУЮ.
Дякуємо за сина, дякуємо, що ви у нас є!

Господи, будь ласка, почуй молитви кожного з нас і зупини війну 🙏
Зупини цього агресора путіна, Росії, яка прийшла на нашу землю зі злом.

Так не має бути!
Благаємо дати шанс на життя на НАШІЙ УКРАЇНСЬКІЙ ЗЕМЛІ 🇺🇦❤️

We are aiming to raise $10,000 and every dollar counts! As a company, we will match up to $3,000, and all donations will be sent to the International Committee of the Red Cross relief effort in Ukraine. 💛💙💛💙💛⁠
⁠
If you haven't met Annie, now is a great time to. We're spotlighting her, along with other women #movetogetherlive teachers, for Women's History Month. Born in Ukraine and raised in Canada, Anastasiya is a 200HR RYT who specializes in Hatha, vinyasa, pranayama, and meditation. Reflecting her passion for both asana and philosophy, Anastasiya's classes bring a mixture of meaningful yoga themes, powerful movement experiences, and deep stretching to help build strength while leaving the body feeling refreshed and the mind rejuvenated.⁠
⁠
In addition to her love of yoga, Annie is a part of the Yoga International Marketing team as a PPC manager, bringing her skills and passion into alignment.⁠
⁠
To get to know her even better, we asked her a simple question: ""What inspires you to teach yoga?"" And this was her full response: ""Yoga has brought a tremendous amount of healing and strength into my life. For me, it's not just a physical practice but a strengthening of the mind and soul as well. Through yoga practice and philosophy I've been able to gain new tools in navigating life skillfully and my hope is to share those tools with others during my time on this planet. I hope to spread inner peace, awareness, and self-love through Yoga to as many souls as possible.""⁠

I was born in Kherson and raised in Zaporizhzhya. These two cities are unfortunately experiencing unspeakable tragedy.

This GoFundMe campaign aims to provide direct aid to Ukrainians suffering from war on their land. All donations will go to my friends Lena and Sasha Kriuchkov, who will then distribute aid to those in the community: providing funds for transport to safer areas, money for food/necessities, and financial assistance to those who have lost their homes, their possessions, and their loved ones.

Hello, my name is Nikita, I am from Ukraine, originally from Odessa, but I lived in Kharkov for the last two years. Due to recent events, I had to leave this city, on the 8th day of the war, on March 3rd, I went to my relatives in Odessa, three days later, due to the tense situation, I had to leave the country.

I've been in shock for the most part during this whole time. First, numb and unable to process what was happening, then after 2 weeks, I couldn't stop crying. Now I've arrived to feel that none of what I've done so far is enough. My home country is being bombed and shelled every day. People don't have running water, food or heat. It's absolutely devastating that one person was able to inflict so much suffering on the whole world. 
A lot of you have reached out to me asking where you could donate and I appreciate it so much. It gave me the idea to set up my own GoFundMe so we can all help Ukraine together.
Please click the link in my bio to donate if you're in the position to do so.

Some words from her:
My name is Lalita, I am a musician and I am from Ukraine. I was born in Lugansk. Unfortunately in 2014 I had to go on my own to study in Kharkov, because there was a war in my hometown. I hoped that I would never have to face sirens and explosions in the streets and curfew again.
To my great regret, eight years later, in 2022 I was caught up in the war in Kharkov, in that city which had become my second home. On February 24, I woke up to calls from relatives and the news that the war had started. It came as a shock to me, I couldn't believe it was all happening. Not until I heard the explosions and saw the tanks in the streets. 
I understood that there was no point in sitting in basements, especially after I had recently been ill and hadn't quite recovered yet. 
One of the worst moments was when bombs and planes started exploding near my house, it got to the point that when there were hours of silence I could not sleep, because it was quiet...
After eight days of shelling I decided to leave Kharkov for Odessa. After about 3 days there too, I began to smell the heat and decided to leave Ukraine.
For me it was a very difficult decision because it was my home country, but I understood that the less people are now in the cities under fire, the easier on the soul of the guys who are on the defensive, because God forbid, but a shell will hit a house, people will not suffer.
At present I am in Switzerland and I want very much with the music to support morally people which have remained in Ukraine. But for this I need strings and repair my bow.

If you wish to help the other musicians you can donate to my PayPal

Olena Orman and her husband Anass arrived in Ireland almost two weeks ago after fleeing from Kyiv.

Ukraine refugees are currently being housed in hotels across the country and the couple have been staying in the Travelodge in Ballymun since their arrival. 

Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast this morning Anass told Shane that the back window was smashed in and everything of value was taken – including clothes, shoes, a guitar, a tablet and a laptop.

Meals From Marlow was originally launched in April 2020 to distribute free meals to local healthcare workers, and others in need and has so far delivered 134,000 meals in Marlow and the surrounding area. In its third year, the team want to continue delivering at least 600 meals every week to those in need. They also want to allocate a proportion of funds raised to support Ukrainian refugees.

To give the 2022 fundraising a BIG kick start, there was a fundraising event at the Compleat Angler yesterday, which raised an amazing £102,000!! 

Thanks to the venue being provided at no charge, and chefs, celebs and other volunteers giving their time – it meant all ticket sale proceeds could go direct to Meals from Marlow. In addition the event was a platform for a charity auction,  hosted by Chris Evans, which boosted funds massively.

What an amazing night - hosted by @chrisphughes51 with food from  @cheftomkerridge  and @chefatulkochhar ,  comedy from @russellbrand , a superb performance by @mica_paris_soul and finishing with a DJ set by none other than @realjudgejules -  but of course it was all about the fundraising, and on that front alone it was a huge success!

I organized it while feeling so dark reading the news and worrying about the world. After the concert, it feels like there is a bit more light.

More than 150 people attended and we raised almost $5000 for @doctorswithoutborders who are providing medical humanitarian assistance to people in Ukraine and all around the world. If you can support, please consider contributing at gofundme.com/musicforukraine 

My friends and I played music by Lysenko, Skoryk, Gliere, Bach, Brahms, Debussy, Schumann, Janacek, Milhaud, Chopin, Villa Lobos and Glass. I played my latest composition at the end too which was such a memorable experience for me.

Сашко народився абсолютно здоровою дитиною, але його зріст поступово сповільнювався і в 5 років був встановлений діагноз: гіпофізарний нанізм, це рідкісне захворювання, яке застерегти неможливо, але піддається коригуванню і вимагає терапії штучним гормоном росту. 💉

Організм гіпофізом не виробляє свій гормон росту, що призводить до затримки лінійного зросту та розвитку внутрішніх органів, які значно зменшені в розмірах та впливають на роботу усього організму і якості життя, але якщо продовжувати гормональну терапію, то організм та внутрішні органи будуть розвиватися пропорційно правильно та функціонувати як у здорової людини.

Дякую кожному за підтримку та увагу до нас ❤️

The Red Cross is doing critical humanitarian work in Kharkiv. They bring food, essential medicine and supplies to residents cut off from the world. They have doctors and medics on hand. Their call centers work round the clock. The volunteers flag the neediest. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
They manage great risk and chaotic environments. They take rapidly evolving situations with stride. They bring so much heart and courage into their work. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Along our journey in Kharkiv, we’ve been sharing the stories of people that they serve and help. It is a great privilege to observe the Red Cross do their work. They have not gone home. They cohabitate, laugh, eat and work together. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
“Understand that as a result of a conflict, tremendous amount of people are in a difficult situation. Our first priority are these people. So the harder that situation is, the higher our priority,” says Kostiantyn Bashkirov who leads the Kharkiv Red Cross. He keeps a piece of shrapnel found nearby as a ghastly reminder of the horrors of war.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He leads by example. He resides in a shelter with the team. He volunteers as a driver. He wears many different hats. He helps with manual labor. So does the rest of his team. They follow his lead. Many follow him into the unknown. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
To keep morale up, the group cooks warm meals & dines together. Pineapple juice for pizzaz. Instant mash potatoes for warmth. Kostiantyn often jokes & tells stories to encourage his team. One night, he reminds them that he is glad to see everyone alive. They returned from a resupply to a town liberated from the Russians. He raises his juice cup to his team: “For us, and each and every moments of our lives.” ⁣⁣

⁣⁣
The Red Cross is doing critical humanitarian work in Kharkiv. They bring food, essential medicine and supplies to residents cut off from the world. They have doctors and medics on hand. Their call centers work round the clock. The volunteers flag the neediest. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
They manage great risk and chaotic environments. They take rapidly evolving situations with stride. They bring so much heart and courage into their work. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Along our journey in Kharkiv, we’ve been sharing the stories of people that they serve and help. It is a great privilege to observe the Red Cross do their work. They have not gone home. They cohabitate, laugh, eat and work together. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
“Understand that as a result of a conflict, tremendous amount of people are in a difficult situation. Our first priority are these people. So the harder that situation is, the higher our priority,” says Kostiantyn Bashkirov who leads the Kharkiv Red Cross. He keeps a piece of shrapnel found nearby as a ghastly reminder of the horrors of war.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He leads by example. He resides in a shelter with the team. He volunteers as a driver. He wears many different hats. He helps with manual labor. So does the rest of his team. They follow his lead. Many follow him into the unknown. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
To keep morale up, the group cooks warm meals & dines together. Pineapple juice for pizzaz. Instant mash potatoes for warmth. Kostiantyn often jokes & tells stories to encourage his team. One night, he reminds them that he is glad to see everyone alive. They returned from a resupply to a town liberated from the Russians. He raises his juice cup to his team: “For us, and each and every moments of our lives.” ⁣⁣

Month ago i joined Anastasiya Naplekova and we together began to promote our fund, me from Ukraine, she -  from US. For now we've collected about 15 000 $. About our fund, it's aim and people we helped you can read in Anastasiya`s posts on the page of fund. I can just say that we send money to a big about of people and for now we used almost all money from fund.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-musicians-in-kharkiv-ukraine?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=m_pd+share-sheet

Also during last month I've been receiving on my personal account about 1 500 $ and to my father's account about 650 $.
I launched my PayPal account 21 of march 2022, during this time a got estimated total of all currencies 5 400 $. 
I personally sent money for 14 people. The biggest sums were 1 000 $, twice i sent such sum to families of musicians escaped from Mariupol, less sums were sent to families of my collegues who lost their apartments in Kharkiv. Some small sums were sent to children of my friends who had to left Ukraine for buying music instruments equipment. Several people didn't wanted me to say their names. So i will not post there payments details. 
Overall i sent for people about 5 000 $ and 2 550 $ remain.
It's difficult to count absolutely accurate because of changing currency courses.
Me, Anastasiya and all the people who received help from us are grateful to all donatots, recent and future, and hope for the soon end of the war!

Wie ihr vielleicht wisst, organisiert der Berliner CSD e.V. jährlich (mit einer pandemischen Ausnahme im Jahr 2020) den Berliner Pride March zum Christopher Street Day mit viel ehrenamtlichem Engagement. 

Bei so einer großen Veranstaltung fallen aber dennoch hohe Kosten an, für die unser Verein aufkommen muss. Um diese decken zu können, suchen wir nicht nur Werbepartner und Sponsoring, sondern brauchen auch die Unterstützung der queeren Communities. Dazu haben wir jetzt eine GoFundMe-Kampagne gestartet.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/44-berliner-csd Den Link findet ihr auch noch einmal in unserer Story.
 
Dabei soll jeder nur das geben, was er geben kann. Auf dem Berliner CSD feiern wir alle zusammen die Freiheiten und die Akzeptanz, die wir hier genießen können. Wir demonstrieren für eine sich diversifizierende Gemeinschaft und für solidarische globale Verbundenheit, dieses Jahr insbesondere mit den queeren Menschen, die aus ihrer Heimat flüchten mussten, aus der Ukraine und von anderswo. 
 
Eure Spenden helfen uns, dies weiterhin zu ermöglichen.
Wir danken euch für eure Unterstützung! 

ENGL.: In 2022 the CSD will be celebrated in Berlin for the 44th time!
 
As you may know, the Berlin CSD e.V. organizes the Berlin Pride March for Christopher Street Day every year with a lot of voluntary commitment. Dozens of people are already working for pride out of pure love, in the weeks before the march and on the day itself, hundreds will be joining them.

With such a large event, there are still high costs that our association has to pay for. In order to be able to cover these costs, we are not only looking for advertising partners and sponsoring, but also need the support of the queer communities. 

We have now started a GoFundMe campaign for this: https://www.gofundme.com/f/44-berliner-csd. You can also find this Link in our Insta-Story.
 
At the Berlin CSD we march for an increasingly diversified community and for global solidarity, especially with the queer people who had to flee their homeland, from Ukraine and from elsewhere.
 
Your donations help us to do this. 
We thank you for your support!

My good friend, the mother of my wonderful student Masha Zhuravlyova is asking for help. Masha was the person who inspired me to make music video when the war began and her mother Marina Bodhi Ma is volunteer who helped me several times with medicine. 
Marina's friends, Tai Chi instructor Volodymyr and his wife Ksenia, were rescued from the shelling in Kharkiv this days. Their house is in an area that is now under heavy shelling, part of their house has been destroyed.
 The reason they have not moved out so far is their dogs, who are now thankfully with them, and their valuable and rare library.
We are now looking to evacuate them, along with the animals and collection, to western Ukraine.
You can send specifically for Volodymyr and Ksenia.

The family of piano player and teacher Anna, her mother Olga, also musician, husband Arkady, and two children Anastasiya (18) and Denis (9), who play piano as well, escaped from Mariupol. They are safe in western Ukraine now but they run away with empty hands. Just saving their lifes. 
Words from Anna:
“We were living in my hometown of Mariupol with my family, i working at the Mariupol College of Arts as a piano teacher and accompanist. After Russian troops invaded our Ukrainian land, my family's happy life, like many other families, was destroyed, as was our home, our city... We were in a basement in Mariupol for a month of war, but when the opportunity to leave came, we took it to save our children's lives”

Anna didn't want to ask for money, i found her due to our common friend, also musician.

As part of my exhibition PROTEST SIGNS at @hugomichellgallery featuring hand knitted homages to protest signs around the world, I created a piece to raise funds for charities working on the current Ukrainian humanitarian crisis.

This unique artwork is a hand knitted Ukrainian flag mounted on a plywood board with a Tasmanian oak picket stick. The words PEACE - in black - are knitted into the flag design.

To help raise money and go into a draw to win this work, all you need to do is donate $50 (or more!) to one of the following three charities: 

@careaustralia - a Australian charity raising funds to end global poverty. They have an ongoing focus on women and girls and a specific focus on the Ukraine right now

Many Black people are facing racism in Ukraine. At the borders trying to escape, they are facing abuse and refused access to trains, busses and support. Members of this Black coalition are working with partner orgs and will be travelling to bordering countries to help bring people home and ensure that this process is done smoothly.

Я пожертвувала багатьом, щоб займатись улюбленою справою, а саме спортом. Я невпинно трудилася и уперто йшла до своєї мрії: привести медаль з міжнародних змагань, щоб лунав гімн моєї любої країни)
Через російську агресію в Україні не вистачає коштів на забеспечення спортсменів для їх участі на міжнародних змаганнях.

За цим посиланням я збираю кошти на  поїздку на Всесвітні ігри. Минулого року я відібралась на ці престижні змагання. Це як Олімпійські ігри, тільки по марафону. Я та @riabovvv маємо честь представляти там нашу Україну. Це наша особиста боротьба у цій війні. 
Нам дуже потрібна ваша допомога! Навіть невелика сума буде величезним внеском у цю справу🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦

Я з України 🇺🇦 м.Київ.

Нажаль я попав під категорію дітей, яким дуже важко даються сантиметри зросту 🙆‍♂️ Мій організм гіпофізом не виробляє свій гормон, який призводить до затримки фізичного розвитку всього скелету та зменшення внутрішніх органів, що впливає на роботу усього організму та якості життя, але якщо продовжувати необхідну гормональну терапію, то моє тіло буде розвиватися пропорційно правильно і функціонувати як у здорової людини 💪

Мені потрібна щоденна замісна терапія штучним гормоном 💉, яку ви допомагаєте моїй мамі купувати, за що вам величезна вдячність 🤗

Кожен сантиметр зростання мені дається все складніше і дорожче.

Дякую усім, хто бере участь у моєму зростанні і допомагає нашій сім'ї ростити мене повноцінним чоловіком!💪😘

Since 10 March, a total of $1,400 has been sent into my and my dad's bank accounts. My PayPal account has received about $9000. So totally its about $10,400 (roughly, taking into account currency exchange rate differences from conversion patterns). 
I spent $7,720. Of these, 820 were transferred to Ksenia and her fund for helping children and replaced people in Dnipro. $4,000 were sent to 4 families of musicians who have escaped from Mariupol. About $2,000 was transferred to 5 families of musicians who lost their apartments as a result of the bombing in Kharkiv. Slightly more than $700 was sent to children and student musicians who left Kharkiv. About $200 was sent to students and teachers remaining in Kharkiv to buy food and medicine.
Anastasia and I have raised $18,645 so far. Most of it has been transferred to Ukrainian musicians affected by the war. Updates on the fund's activities are made by Anastasia on the page

Thanks to your donations we have been able to help several dozen Ukrainian musicians who have lost their homes, their possessions and sometimes their relatives, who have been forced to leave their homes and who need medical help. 
Together with you we will continue to help our colleagues and hope for a speedy victory!

Ми вдома, в Україні, м.Київ.

Нам дуже треба викупити необхідні ліки 💉поки вони є в наявності в періоді военного стану в Україні 🇺🇦

Не буває пізно, буває вже не треба. На розвиток сина я можу впливати тільки зараз за допомогою цих препаратів. 🙏🙏🙏
Нам вони ну дужеееее потрібні

Більш ніж пів дороги вже пройдено і досягнуто 146 см 🙆‍♂️💪, але зупинятися в гормональному лікуванні неможливо.

Тому я прошу підтримати нас по можливості.

Я дякую КОЖНОМУ, хто з нами увесь цей час.
Фінансово, морально, допомагає розповсюдженням історії да будь як.
Дякую, що ви у нас є ❤️

Тримаюся і вірю у дві перемоги
