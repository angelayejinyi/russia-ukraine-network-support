Only months ago, my publisher in Ukraine sent these beautiful images of the Ukrainian edition of Before We Were Yours packaged in book bags with items made by local artisans in Kharkiv. Only weeks ago, people were going about their lives there -- smart, creative, hard-working people with jobs and skills and homes and families. Now they are fighting for their lives or running for their lives. Please do all you can the help with whatever resources you can offer. Pray for them. Lobby on their behalf. Speak up for them. Spread the word. Donate (pasting some links below). Let's hasten the day in Ukraine when the sky is for birds and clouds, and publishers publish, and artisans create art, and readers read books in peace. 

Adding sunflowers here (sunyashniki in Ukrainian), a beloved symbol of peace in Ukraine. Soon. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
