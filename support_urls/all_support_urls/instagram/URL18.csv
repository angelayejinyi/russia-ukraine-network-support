Ep. 8 | Julie Poly capturing Ukrainian women

For our next conversation of our podcast series ‘Miista Says’, we speak with Ukrainian photographer @julie_poly . We’re so grateful we were able to work with Julie Poly on this podcast, and it’s hard to speak about her and not to acknowledge the current political situation in Ukraine at this time, and how this is deeply affecting women and women's involvement in times of conflict.

We are donating to Razom For Ukraine who support humanitarian aid. 

Copy the link to donate 
https://razomforukraine.org/razom-emergency-response/

We were honoured to speak with Julie earlier this year. She is an incredible photographer, known for her fusion between documentary and fashion photography, meshing humanity into her gaze of the glamour and power of women in Ukraine. 

You may know Julie from the images in her book Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukrainian Railways - where she captured the drama of the Ukrainian train lines, where Julie used to work herself as a conductor. Join our host @graceelenabanks as we learn the significance and relatability of the train journeys in Ukraine, and how Julie was constantly inspired by the characters and settings she was immersed in. 

Julie’s book and zine are available on her website:  www.juliepoly.com

We are a real organization run by real people. (See pictures for proof.) 

We are extremely overwhelmed with requests and messages through all our sources – email, Facebook, Instagram. And although our team of volunteers is up 24/7 as we scale our efforts to provide what is needed in Ukraine, the flow of emails and messages are overwhelming. 

We strongly recommend you search answers in the Frequently Asked Questions on our website first:

Ukrainian fans I’ve met in person or talked to on here over the years, we love you and you are in our thoughts every day multiple times a day. 
Here are some links to reputable organizations that are directly helping Ukrainians:
https://razomforukraine.org - providing medical supplies & necessities
https://www.unicef.org/ukraine/en - focused support for Ukrainian children & families + info and updates on their website
GlobalGiving Ukraine Relief Fund - also providing necessities for Ukrainians and refugees who have fled the country
https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/countries/ukraine - provides a range of medical care for victims
if any of you are in Ukraine in need of financial aid or know of an Ukrainian organization that does, please send me a dm and I’d be MORE than happy to share it.
I am also thinking of Africans and Indians in Ukraine who are experiencing SEGREGATION and being denied access to transportation. So absolutely horrifying that this is happening even in the midst of war. 
Here are some links to help African refugees in Ukraine:
https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8HCRfpHxO1 - a fundraiser by Tokunbo Koiki that is providing flights for African students to leave the country
https://lnkj.in/p/nido - provides multiple different links to donate to africans fleeing to specific countries & includes phone numbers to NIDO leaders in those countries. website also includes life saving tips for refugees.
thinking of Russian families who are being detained for protesting the war and having to spend nights in jail with their children.
I am always thinking of the Palestinian men, women, and children who are experiencing unspeakable violence and bloodshed by the israeli occupation and have been for too long. Just this week, 4+ young men around my age were killed by Israeli soldiers and one of their homes at a refugee camp was raided prior. Children being rushed to hospitals because of grenades.
I’ll post links to help Palestinian refugees in comments below, caption is too long. sending every ounce of love I have to you all.",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cav4kTigogZ/,https://razomforukraine.org,razomforukraine.org,razomforukraine

In particular because this current series is called Destination Home and because I want to raise awareness on how precious eachs persons home is, that nobody should have the right to just march into it and destroy it, and that rights like the freedom of speech and freedom of the media is a fundamental principle that we have to fight for, no matter what.

The video on Thursday will take you on a little adventure and I hope the fantastic views will distract your mind from the current events for a few minutes. We will visit the famous Assietta Ridge Road in Italy - some people say that this is one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL ROADS IN THE WORLD. There will be a small excursion to my travel partners and mine past and I will have to deal with an unexpected breakdown.

Like many others I feel very helpless in the current situation - and the only thing I can do is donating some money. That's why I decided to donate half of the Ad-revenues of the upcoming video (I wish I could donate all of it, but I need to cover at least a little part of the production costs...) to Razom for Ukraine ( https://razomforukraine.org/ ), that is providing critical medical supplies and amplifying the voices of Ukrainians. Razom as well put together a list of links with organizations to donate to or if you can't donate events to attend, so everyone can find a cause they can support: https://linktr.ee/RazomForUkraine
So it is even more imoportant that you guys join my ride on Thursday at 7:30 PM CET, give the video a thumbs up and comment, so we can raise at least a little money. See you on Thursday!

My heart aches for the refugee flight of women and children taking place in Europe from Ukraine. Kids sent alone for their safety boarded trains to destinations they are unfamiliar with. 

Today is international women's day. I wish you strength for the decision you are making, for the war you're fighting for the journey you're taking. #gogreendress

Just as we've worked hard to move humanitarian aid (tacmed, hospital med) across borders and into Ukraine, we've simultaneously developed an evacuation system for some of the most vulnerable in times of war -- children and children with disabilities. 

It started with children with SMA (spinal muscular atrophy) that Razom is connected through the “Dity, My Vstygnemo” - “Children, We Will Make It” Діти ми встигнемо project, launched in 2021 as a civic movement and advocacy campaign to improve healthcare access for Ukrainian children suffering from SMA. 

In times of war, children with disabilities need to be evacuated early before they are in danger of missing out on special care and assistance needed to thrive and survive. 

Razom (in a group with 12 incredible volunteers across the US and Ukraine) have evacuated children from 9 cities and regions, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Zhytomyr, Dnipro, Irpin, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, and Kryvyi Rih.

We worked with the @allhandsandhearts nonprofit to help procure minivans, and have partnered with the Polish SMA Foundation to take care of these children once getting them across the border. We also coordinated with our partners @burburbuuur and @ukredplatform on this effort. 

Please consider donating to Razom's Emergency Response project and/or BUR for us to continue to scale this operation. 
Your donations, shares, and likes make these evacuations possible.

Віримо, що завдяки роботі тилу наші бійці сильніші, вмотивованіші і з більшим завзяттям крошитимуть ворогів. 

А сьогодні хочемо подякувати всім волонтерам, які 25й день війни невпинно працюють на другому фронті. 
Дякуємо вам, друзі! 🤩

🇺🇸We have a lot of news for you today.
-A load of cargo was delivered to Kharkiv civilian territorial defence
-A load of insulin that came all the way from Berlin was also delivered to Kharkiv; Thanks to the work of the Ukrainian Diabetes Association, Kharkiv residents will be provided with insulin for some time
-A new cargo load was delivered to the warehouse in Lviv; 40 more pallets of tactical medicine!
-the first batch of drones (50) arrived from Poland, which will be sent tomorrow to the territorial defences that have drone pilots already. These drones will help ensure the safe delivery of medical supplies. 

We believe that thanks to the work of the backend, Ukraine's fighters are stronger, more motivated and will crush their enemies with greater zeal.

And today we want to thank all the volunteers who work tirelessly on the ""second front"" on the 25th day of the war.
Thank you, friends! 🤩

Here's what Razomers on the other side of the Atlantic have managed to achieve:

Over $4M has been spent on tactical medicine supplies (out of the $8.5M Razom has spent towards its Emergency Response Project). 

Razom is averaging procuring 10,000 tourniquets per week (worth over $250,000/week) from the most reputable suppliers buying CAT, SOF-T and/or SAM brands. These single-use devices continue to be the most sought-after and requested across Ukraine as they play a huge role in life-or-death extreme situations by stopping arterial bleeding. 
 
Thanks to our strong ties to communities and professionals on the ground in Ukraine, we're able to learn about exact needs quickly and act on some specific (if not esoteric) requests that can make a big difference. A good example has been SAM splints (procured over 3,100 of them for $56,100), designed for immobilizing bone and soft tissue injuries in emergency settings. 

What's more, we work hard and smart with your donation money by researching the best possible supply chain deals. Aside from the 80 SAM splints that we secured for free, our best negotiated discount was 60% off.

We've purchased over 10,300 FoxSeal chest seals for over $58,000. Ukrainians in the U.S. and Canada have really stepped up to the plate in procuring these because the supply of FoxSeal chest seals has been completely depleted in North America. So we found contacts to buy some from Australia and the U.K that total 6,000 which are due to arrive in our warehouse in western Ukraine later this week.

Razom volunteers put together 2,000 IFAK kits in one week in our New Jersey warehouse. These trauma kits containing essential life-saving materials are worth collectively over $200,000. 

Please consider making a gift to Razom's Emergency Response Project so that we can continue to meet the evolving needs of Ukrainians by providing critical humanitarian war relief and recovery.

It's good to be Razom!

One of Ukraine’s most famous Easter traditions, Pysanky are intricately decorated Easter eggs made using colorful dyes and wax. Mira learned how to make Pysanky from her mother who created hundreds of one of a kind Pysanky and exhibited in libraries and a museum in Ukraine. This photo shows a Pysanka that Mira made when she was 14 years old surrounded by the beautiful Pysanky made by her mother, Nina Hnatyshyn. We will have some of Mira’s family Pysanky on view during First Friday only!

Mira’s exhibition Euroscapes was featured at BSC in 2014 and her practice highlighted in our Open Studios video series available on our YouTube channel.

During this First Friday we will be collecting donations in support of Ukranian relief efforts during this unprecedented time of Russian military invasion.

Putting together this briefing was of utmost importance for the Razom Advocacy Team and an important step in establishing the Team as a trusted source and relationship for and with staffers of key offices and decision makers.

From the first days of russian’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine, our long-time partner organization “Building Ukraine Together” (БУР/BUR) Будуємо Україну Разом @burburbuuur shifted their focus to helping Ukrainians in and from the most affected cities and towns. 

Having a trusted partner on the ground is a great benefit for Razom to make a faster impact given BUR has a large network of skilled and reliable volunteers across Ukraine thanks to years of organized rebuilding projects and camps all over the country. 

Now, during the war, these volunteers have transformed into agents of support to the most vulnerable groups in war-torn areas.

In early March, Razom decided to provide a second grant to help accelerate BUR’s efforts. From the latest BUR report, we can see that the funds were well spent, efficiently closing the gaps in provision and support. 

According to the report, between March 24 – April 10 in cooperation with other Ukrainian Education Platform’s programs, BUR teams have managed to:

❣️help over 3,000 people with humanitarian supply in 12 oblasts of Ukraine; 
❣️place over 20,000 people in temporary shelters and homes in the west of Ukraine; 
❣️rebuild a destroyed roof in a Kharkiv multi-family building; 
organize and financially help with evacuation of over 1,300 people, including people from Mariupol through pastor Gennadiy Mokhnenko; 
❣️help a Kyiv volunteer group feed elderly people in the bomb shelters/hospitals and medical personnel (supporting over 1,000 people overall);
❣️prepare and launch two volunteering camps that will revamp homes for over 60 IDPs in Drohobych/Ivano-Frankivsk; 
❣️fund a sewing business that will employ 5 IDPs in Lviv region in 1 month and over 15 in 2 months;
❣️deliver 75 fridges for blood preservation to 50 hospitals around Ukraine.
