RP: As the industry gathers to celebrate young talent at the @lvmhprize in Paris, remember that creativity can only thrive when there is peace. Right now, some of the previous nominees are sheltering from bomb attacks and fearing for their lives. Luxury fashion brands have power and influence ‚Äì we demand that they use it to stand up against the senseless violence of this invasion: EMBARGO ON RUSSIA NOW. We cannot accept business as usual.

Some of the world‚Äôs current hunger hotspots such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen will be the most affected because of their dependency on wheat*.

In Ukraine, the exportation of many items are suspended. This includes things such as:

‚ùå Meat
‚ùå Livestock
‚ùå Salt + sugar
‚ùå Buckwheat, oats, millet, and rye

This will hit countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) the hardest. As regions already vulnerable to high food prices, conflict means food resources become even harder to attain and therefore prices will rise. üìà

Conflict has worldwide implications and unfortunately, this means worsening the global food crisis. When we work towards #Goal16 (Peace and Justice), we also help move one step closer to tackling food insecurity and therefore, #Goal2 (Zero Hunger).
