We just can't do them all at the same time, and we can't do them alone. 

My dad turns 70 this week & I hadn't seen him or my beloved mountains since 2019. My friend had twins I'd never met.

But I have a company to run, and the world is a hot mess. 

I also needed time to regroup & reset.

I am beyond grateful for my community üôèüèΩ

‚ÄúWe show solidarity with #Ukraine by creating photographs that reflect the inner strength and dedication to the homeland which don‚Äòt give in to pain. Even at a time when the world seems to be stopping, the invincible spirit does not stop fighting and only begins to burn even more. Strength and vocation do not need to be found anywhere else. Everything is already in you. Stay strong, Ukraine.
Together with the creative team from #Lithuania, we decided to express our support for Ukraine in a way that best reflects our work fields. We encourage other artists around the world to spread the message about the war and to show solidarity.

*The props chosen to create the photos are not the accessories and clothing used in reality. It‚Äôs all part of the style to enhance the message.‚Äù * MIKITA @mikitastudio

This release is showcasing multiple facets of the HARDER sound, that also includes some Trance ü•∞

We decided to use this release as an opportunity to raise funds towards the terrible and inhumane situation that Ukraine is living in, following the Russian invasion and the prolonged war that has been torturing the country for years. Is there anything better than music to help us stand united against war and violence? It‚Äôs important to let our voices be heard, take action and talk about it, otherwise history wouldn‚Äôt have taught us anything!

All the revenue sales (expenses we already sustained included) from this compilation will be donated to the  International Aid fund:
