24th of February was life changing for millions of Ukrainians.

Russia is destroying civil infrastructure like hospitals, kindergartens, schools and homes. 

People are spending nights in shelters, massively leaving their homes to survive the continuing death threats.

Extremely kind Mr. Andriy was inspired by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a refugee station in his restaurant. His establishment had 100 sunbeds, which were quickly converted into comfortable beds. Our foundation purchased mattresses, pillows, blankets and bedding. All the necessary household chemicals and some household clothes.

The room has a very large area, warm and has its own large kitchen. It is very cozy and comfortable for mothers and children. Now the center has received more than 40 people, and is designed for 100.

It was an incredible pleasure for our team to finally see smiles and hope return to tired and scared people.

Thank you so much to everyone who has helped me raise awareness for Voices of Children (@voices_of_children) and the work they do in Ukraine. Since my last update, there have been 92 more participants in my Bookstack for a Cause, and I have made another donation of $184 USD. This brings the total donation amount to $334. Please continue to spread the word! I will donate $2 for every bookstack that uses #bookstackforukraine and tags my account (@nestingwiththebyrds). My goal is to donate $1000. 

Each stack shows support for Ukraine and raises awareness for Voices of Children. This is a Ukrainian organization that has been helping children affected by the war since 2015. They provide psychological and psychosocial support to help children overcome the consequences of armed conflict. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, they have been providing non-stop assistance to affected children and families from all over the country, providing emergency psychological assistance, and assisting in the evacuation process.

Here‚Äôs how you can help: 
üíô Make your own blue and yellow book stack 
üíõ Tag @nestingwiththebyrds in your photo
üíô Use #bookstackforukraine
üíõShare with others and encourage them to participate 
üíô Consider donating if you‚Äôre able. The money goes straight to Ukrainians who know exactly what is needed at this time.

I believe that soon this nightmare will be over and we will have to return to rebuild everything. I have mental need to be in Ukraine, my homeland.

For more than a week, Natalia and her family lived in a basement in Kyiv. Constant sirens, sleepless nights and scared eyes of children who were attacked by russia ‚ö°Ô∏è. It could not go on like this, so the family decided to go to the west of Ukraine.

After 10 hours in the train üöä, completely packed with people, Natalia and her daughter arrived in Truskavets. They stopped and rested at the shelter for refugees, which helped to set up our fund.

Despite everything, the woman believes that they will return soon to their native city of Kyiv, where a loving husband and father are waiting for them.

To help kids cope with trauma, @Voices_Of_Children has been offering art therapy alongside volunteers and mobile psychologists since 2015. Their creative methods allow youth who have trouble processing their feelings to take control of their emotions and express themselves in a way that's comfortable for them.

Currently in Ukraine, volunteers for the organisation are providing 24-hour support to children and families affected by the war, including assistance with evacuation and in temporary refugee shelters. ‚ÄúWe just have to overcome it all,‚Äù Maryna Gubarets, a volunteer, says. ‚ÄúWho else, if not me? There's the motivation.‚Äù Visit https://voices.org.ua/donat/ to contribute to their work on the frontlines of the ongoing conflict.

En la actualidad, colaboran con el proceso de evacuaci√≥n y atienden psicol√≥gicamente a menores y familias residentes y refugiadas. Pensamos que es de especial importancia el trabajo en el √°mbito de la salud mental en una guerra que no solo dejar√° muerte y destrucci√≥n, sino tambi√©n la huella del trauma y del duelo que acompa√±ar√° a las v√≠ctimas mucho m√°s tiempo de lo que podamos escuchar en las noticias o leer en los peri√≥dicos.

‚ÄúA siren sounded during the lesson üì¢, so we went down to the shelter.  The girls were drawing, and after the all-clear signal they didn't want to come back, ‚Äùour psychologist Antonina reports in a work chat.

 During this week we adjusted the work of local centers.  At least 100 children who fled the war to the west of the country received the support of our psychologists in:

 ‚ú®Lviv (three locations)
 ‚ú®Vynnyky and Dublyany
 ‚ú®Truskavets (four locations)
 ‚ú®Shidnytsi
 ‚ú®Poltava
 ‚ú®Kamenets-Podolsky

 The next step is to create centers where children will also receive psychological support in Chernivtsi, Berehove, Khust and Myrnohrad (Donetsk region).

 We are also working to open creative studios in all locations so that as many children as possible can release emotions, cope with stress or homesickness.

 This is all possible thanks to your support.  Thank you to everyone who helps bring bright colors into children's lives todayü§ó Even in shelters. You can support us here: https://voices.org.ua/donat/",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb5Xblrthb2/,https://voices.org.ua/donat/,voices.org.ua,voices

""My Nadiya is in reliable hands"", wrote the mother of three-year-old Nadiya to one of our psychologists, who helps children survive the trauma of war these days.

They left their home on the 5th day of the war and called ay once the We Are Nearby Hotline to get psychological support. This hotline was launched by the Voices of Children together with the NaUKMA Psychosocial Rehabilitation Center.

Nadiya became one of 100 children with whom our psychologists worked during the first month of the hotline operation.

Support until it gets easier and do it promptly. This is the goal our psychologists set for themselves. Thank you for sharing our values. You can join and help children overcome the effects of the war here: https://voices.org.ua/donat/

In the past 6 weeks, she has endured so much‚Äîhaving to leave the only home she‚Äôs known, then her dad, then the country she was born in. Traveling from one foreign place to the next, then across the world. Waiting in line for 14 hours to cross the border with her mom into the United States. And still moving about the world with so much joy, radiance, and energy. Playing and laughing and causing trouble. 

What‚Äôs happening in Ukraine isn‚Äôt lost on her. Her explanation is that aliens have invaded Kyiv, and that her family can‚Äôt return home until they‚Äôre gone. When we were together in Berlin, she‚Äôd often be sad about the things she left behind: a favorite pillow, a beloved toy, slippers she particularly enjoyed. Once, at the park, just the mention of her dads name on the phone from afar made her cry for a very long while. 

I wish the circumstances of their visit to the United States were different. I wish she could have celebrated with her (incredible, amazing, loving) father, at a party with all of her friends. But I am so grateful that she could at the very least be surrounded by family who adores her‚Äîand I realize how lucky we are that they are safe with us. 

So, again, from the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who supported their journey and loves on Kira from afar. I know her light will continue to shine brightly, and that she has many lessons to teach us. üíñ

If you‚Äôre looking to support Ukrainian children, you can donate to @voices_of_children (voices.org.ua/en), or look out for local organizations in your community (try Facebook groups) helping supply refugees with toys and clothing donations. üíó

""I do no live in the country of corridors any more"".

7-year-old Solomon was sitting in the corridor when Kyiv was bombed. His parents dared to flee only when the shells began exploding in their yard.

Our psychologists help Solomon and his older brother to cope with terrible memories. During one of the art therapy classes, the boy made a tank out of plasticine and his brother Mykhailo made a cannon. The psychologist sculpted a fragile blue and yellow üåº flower, looking at which the boys remade their weapons into a peaceful globe.

Children's hearts still see only the good. The light that will always overcome the darkness and the evil. That is why our volunteers and psychologists work every day. Their work is possible due to your supportü§ù Thank you very much.

Wow. Another incredible show for the State Theatre of Ithaca history books. 

Thanks, dakhabrakha. That was an incredible experience for everyone who was in the building last night. 

100% of concession sales during the show have been donated to The Voices of Children Foundation, a Ukrainian charity that provides psychological and psychosocial support to children.

""Russia is stealing our childhood""

Katya is 5, she remembers how she liked going to the world's best kindergarten üè† and playing hide-and-seek with her friends. And then the Russians came and she had to hide from their shelling in the basement.

Katya with her mother and brother are now safe. But the kindergarten did not escape ... The enemies destroyed it with bombs. But the little Ukrainian sincerely believes in the victory of our country üíôüíõ After all, she will return home, to the renovated kindergarten, and she will meet her friends.

We are grateful to everyone who supports us. Thanks to you, Ukrainian children have the opportunity to recover from the traumas of war and believe in the bright future üí´You can join our initiatives here: https://voices.org.ua/donat/",https://www.instagram.com/tv/CcGRg4EFeq1/,https://voices.org.ua/donat/,voices.org.ua,voices

From the first day of the full-scale war, seven-year-old Vika is forced to sit in shelters every day. At first in Kyiv, where she and her family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ were hiding from Russian rockets in an underground parking. Then - in the basement near the refuge for migrants in Lviv, where she moved with her parents and brother.

Every time, sitting in a bomb shelter, Vika dreams that after the war all Ukrainian shelters will be transformed into super-places where children üöÇüß∏can play. We sincerely believe that Victoria's dreams will come true very soon, because her name symbolizes ‚úåÔ∏è ""victory"".

Several russian shells hit the building üè´ when a 6-year-old girl, her two-year-old brother, mother, father and grandmother were hiding from shelling in a school basement.

Today the family is safe in one of the shelters for refugees near Lviv, which was equipped with the help of our fund.

""I'm from Ukraine üá∫üá¶,"" says the first-grader Alina while meeting our volunteers. But the girl can't recall the name of her hometown‚Ä¶

All because of the events she has experienced: Alina's family came under fire in Popasna. Our volunteers helped them get out of the hell arranged by Russia. Alina, her grandmother, father and mother were evacuated to Olexandria. Only here, in safety and in a warm atmosphere ‚òÄÔ∏è, Alina and her family recovered.

In Olexandria, our local coordinators go on receiving people who have been forced to leave their homes. In comfortable conditions, they have the opportunity to rest üõè and refresh themselves with hot meals.

All this is possible due to your support, for which we are grateful beyond measure. ü§óYou can join the charity initiatives by following the link: https://voices.org.ua/donat/",https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccfknc2Nod-/,https://voices.org.ua/donat/,voices.org.ua,voices

Petro is a true warrior of light.

He is on the front line. He risks his life every day to protect üõ° our country. This is not the first battle in Petro's life, because he had been engaged in reconstruction of medieval battles for decades. But now the combat is real.
 
Despite constant danger, our soldiers still to worry about the children üßíüèºüëßüèº of Ukraine. So is Petro. He called on his friends of knights from other countries to help Ukrainian children. When the aid was gathered, Petro asked to pass it to the wards of our Foundation. Yes, just imagine our surprise üòØ when we learned that 2 tons of humanitarian aid are ready to go to us.

Within a few weeks, the aid from Petro and his friends was delivered to our wards in the Donetsk Region and gave a üí´ light of care to dozens of families. We thank the soldiers for such an incredibly bright deed.

The Armed Forces protect, and we continue our work and help children. Become our good knight and support the children of Ukraine here:https://voices.org.ua/donat/",https://www.instagram.com/p/CclKCPNseLE/,here:https://voices.org.ua/donat/,here:https://voices.org.ua/donat/,

The war in Ukraineüá∫üá¶ affects children, interferes with their normal lives and leaves a mark on their mental health. This situation is even more traumatic for children with disabilities.
These children üßíüèº are very sensitive to everything. Now it is very difficult for them to adapt to new conditions. However, rehabilitation classes are a point of support for them. At the Kozyavkin International Rehabilitation Clinic in Truskavets, children üëßüèºfeel safe and mothers receive support.
Psychologists from our foundation help children with disabilities to relax. They conduct art-therapeutic classes üé®. On paper, children may partially leave their feelings and anxieties.
Thanks to your support, our wards are able to receive psychological helpüôå. Thank you for helping to rebuild young Ukrainians at this difficult time.

""Did you know that Lukianivska station was destroyed?""

7-year-old Solomon üë¶ before the start of the full-scale war tried to pass at least a few subway stations every day, even if there was no need. But now for two months people from all Ukrainian cities, where is a subway‚ìÇÔ∏è, use it as a shelter from Russian missile raids.

Solomon and his mother now live in Lviv, in the shelter, equipped with the help of our foundation. The boy is very worried that Russian bombsüí£ and missiles are destroying Kyiv, where he was born. But Solomon also believes that Ukraine will soon win and he will be able to bypass all metro stationsüöá of his hometown ‚Äî Kyiv.

With your support, we are helping Solomon's family and many others to endure hard times in a safe place. We do our best to help them have a roofüè† over their heads, not be hungry and be able to deal with anxiety.

Finally, little Veronica was warmed by the sun üåû
The girl and her family spent 50 days in the Kharkiv metro. On the very first day of the war, their house üè† was bombed by Russian troops.
Veronica received a psychological trauma, so the evacuation was not easy for her. The child held his mother's hand üë©üë¶ tightly and was afraid to come out. However, Veronica bravely managed to overcome her fear ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and now she with her mother and grandmother are safe in the west of Ukraine.
This girl is only one among the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children who are constantly forced to hide in bomb shelters from enemy shelling for a long time. Children need sunlight üåû and a sense of safety ü§ó. But after their experience they also require the help of experts.
We are grateful to everyone who supports the Foundation's activities ü§ó. Thanks to your donations, Ukrainian children receive professional psychological assistance.

Friends, this is incredible. Oprah Winfrey wrote about our foundation. Yes, yes, the American talk show host, television producer, actress and the most influential person in show business ‚≠êÔ∏è in 2009 according to Forbes magazine.

""The courage of the Ukrainian peopleüí™has lit a fire üî•within people all over the world‚Äîcount me among them,"" Oprah writes fascinatingly about Ukrainians. ""As I write this, rockets batter Ukraine and convoys of Russian troops stand ready to move into its largest cities"".

Oprah encourages the world to support Ukrainian people and Ukrainian children. Among the links to proven funds - the Voices of Children. We are infinitely grateful for the trust üíõ and support.

""It is very important to teach children that mines, ammunition, explosives üí£or even their wreckage are definitely not toys,"" said Olena Rozvadovska, founder of Voices of Children.

Unfortunately, the territory of Ukraine is currently almost half mined. There are more and more reports in the media üì∫ that children have been blown up by mines. Adults üë®üë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhave to warn and warn children against such findings. That is why our task is to teach children the rules of behavior with explosive objects.

Today, many people are returning to their homes üèöliberated from the occupiers. They can be killed or seriously injured at any time, even in their own homes, as war criminals leave their mark anywhere: in houses, parksüå≥, forests and just on the streets.

What to do to take care of a childüßíüèº, read tips from our Olena on the site:https://voices.org.ua/news/znannia-iaki-riatuiut-zhyttia/",https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc0M4zVMH6l/,:https://voices.org.ua/news/znannia-iaki-riatuiut-zhyttia/,:https://voices.org.ua/news/znannia-iaki-riatuiut-zhyttia/,
