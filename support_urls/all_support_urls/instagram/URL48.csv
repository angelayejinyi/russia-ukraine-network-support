Brian Chesky announced the move in a series of tweets on Monday morning.

He wrote: “Airbnb and Airbnb.org are working with our Hosts to house up to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine, for free.

“We need help to meet this goal. The greatest need we have is for more people who can offer their homes in nearby countries, including Poland, Germany, Hungary and Romania. If you can host a refugee, go here: airbnb.org/get-involved.”

He added: “All stays are free for refugees, funded by Airbnb, Airbnb.org donors and through the generosity of Hosts.”

The United Nations says over 360,000 refugees have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin launched his attack last week.

My grandma who is now 84, was a young girl during WWII and experienced first hand war stories, remembers everything that happened during those few years and all the aftermath following. It’s been 8 days now, enough to turn people’s lives/families upside down.

But we’ve been seeing so many people coming together and trying to help in any way they can.  Getting funds, gathering medicine, supplies, clothes, shoes, blankets, anything that may be of need for refugees or civilians currently stuck in Ukraine.

Today I think we can all agree the people of Ukraine are superheroes. The grit, the determination, and the love of freedom found in Ukraine is astounding. I don’t know if I would do the same. These heroes challenge me to approach my life with more gratitude and more courage.

The first photo is of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who when offered the opportunity to flee Ukraine, said “ I don’t need a ride, I need more ammunition.”
.
The next photo is of school teachers in Ukraine ready to go into battle, risking their lives for freedom.
.
And the last is of people in Russia standing up against their government, risking jail time and suppression.
.
To all of my readers in Ukraine, you inspire us and set an example that ordinary people can be extraordinarily brave.
.
I will continue to be a witness, not to look away from this atrocity and to do what I can. Today what I can do is donate to https://www.airbnb.org to help house refugees. It’s not enough but it’s a start.
