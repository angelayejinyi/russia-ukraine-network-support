The brewing community has always been one of support, unity, and kindness. Many of us around the globe have asked what we can do to help the millions in need. The ""Brew for Ukraine"" project was created to do just that.

Last week, we brewed an award-winning recipe from the Lviv-based @pravdabrewery titled ""Red Eyes"". For this American Red Ale, we will be donating 100% of the proceeds to Pravda's @brewforukraine GoFundMe, where funds will be allocated for humanitarian efforts and food relief. 

If you would like to make a personal donation, or learn more about these organizations and fund distributions, see the links attached below. 

Keep your eyes out for our official release date announcement soon.

This is a continuation of my ‚ÄúAnimation Glossary‚Äù project, about straight ahead and pose to pose animation. 

Explanation for non-animators: when animating straight ahead without blocking key poses, a character quickly gets off model and shrinks in size.

For this episode, hosts Sophie and Alice Kanako are showing solidarity with Ukraine paying specific attention to the highly active and innovative Ukrainian music scene, and pointing you towards donation hubs to help people in Ukraine. Listen in for an hour of sounds large enough to fill any warehouse including darkwave, snarling acid techno, and vicious soundscape work.

Use this hour to route into following artists that can tell you more about what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine,¬† and better connect to their music scene.

17:00 Loose Fit Radio
Tune in for Polly‚Äôs latest Loose Fit show featuring the best new post-punk, indie and alternative bands/artists. This month features tracks from Duvet, NARA, The Stealers, Lynks, Confidence Man and more!‚Äô

18:00 OG OR MAN 69 ‚Äì Jesus Christ! He‚Äôs Back!

OMG ‚Äì OG OR MAN returns with some sort of Easter special. Apparently harder to get rid of than a Russian warship, expect the usual random cross-references and hot cross puns.

Including, inter alia: a heap of angular indie, stuff about nails, eclectic electronica, whimsical mysticism, classical choral, panic button punk and delirious DIY.

And some serendipitous verse from the very edge of Stockport.

OG OR MAN - music to put you in a right mood.
