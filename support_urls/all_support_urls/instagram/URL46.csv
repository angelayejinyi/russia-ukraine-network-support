It's hard to tell uplifting stories and spread positivity, when there is so much going wrong in the world at the moment. I am especially sorry for all the people, who are feeling the direct catastrophic impacts of war, losing their loved ones, homes, hope. 

As you know emperor penguins are incredible parents, teaching their offspring the virtues of the colony early on in their lives. It is crucial for the chicks and also the colony's survival. 

I feel the only thing we can do is to teach our kids the crucial virtues of human survival: care for other human beings, care for all living creatures and care for this planet.

Together with other National Geographic photographers, we will be organizing a print sale to help provide medical aid to people displaced or affected by the conflict in Ukraine. I will share details soon. 100% of the profits will go to Direct Relief (https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/ukraine-crisis/)

Let's all hope and pray for peace!
