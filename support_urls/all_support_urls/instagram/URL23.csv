وهدفها الرئيسي هو توفير المعلومات المتحقق منها حول الوضع في أوكرانيا والطرق المحددة لدعم أوكرانيا وكذلك إظهار البعد الإنساني لحركة المقاومة.

قال وزير الخارجية الأوكراني دميترو كوليبا إن هذا الموقع في الواقع توثيق مباشر للحرب التي تتكشف أمام أعين العالم، وأردف قائلاً إنه بعد الانتصار في هذه الحرب في نهاية المطاف سيكون بمثابة أرشيف تم جمعه بعناية للجرائم والفظائع والهمجية الروسية وكذلك في المقام الأول – لأمثلة بطولة ووحدة الشعب الأوكراني.

ويمكنكم الآن الاطلاع في هذا الموقع على المعلومات التالية:

- أسباب الغزو الروسي لأوكرانيا.
- المستجدات الأخيرة في أوكرانيا: يحتوي الموقع على آخر التحديثات من مصادر رسمية.
- سبل مساعدة الأوكرانيين: الروابط والتعليمات المفيدة حول إمكانية تقديم التبرعات للقوات المسلحة الأوكرانية أو الانضمام إلى الفيلق الأجنبي للدفاع الإقليمي لأوكرانيا أو تقديم المساعدة الإنسانية أو تنظيم التظاهرة الاحتجاجية ضد الحرب في وسط أوروبا.
- الوجوه الحقيقية لحركة المقاومة الأوكرانية. الأحداث الحالية الواقعة في أوكرانيا حرب شعبية. وهذا الفصل مخصص للأوكرانيين الذين يقومون بمقاومة بطولية وغير مسبوقة ضد المحتلين الروس. يستحق كل موطن أوكراني مهما كان رجلا أو إمرأة يدافع عن الحرية والقيم المشتركة وأمن القارة الأوروبية كلها أن يعرفه العالم.
تم إنشاء هذا الموقع على أساس منصة ukraine.ua التي سبق لها أن تقدم صورة أوكرانيا للعالم كبلد للحرية والكرامة ودولة أوروبية معاصرة يمتد تاريخها وثقافتها ألف سنة. وبعد بدء الغزو الروسي الواسع النطاق لأوكرانيا، قد تغير هدف المنصة التي تتيح حاليا للمجتمع الدولي إمكانية الوصول الحر إلى معلومات صادقة وصحيحة حول الحرب في أوكرانيا.
يساعد كل منكم الشعب الأوكراني في الدفاع عن أرضه وحرية أوروبا كلها عن طريق نشر المعلومات حول موقع war.ukraine.ua بين أصدقائكم وشركائكم الأجانب.

المجد لأوكرانيا!

On the website, experience just a fraction of how Ukrainians have been forced to live for more than six weeks. To hear the sounds of air raid sirens, warplanes and missile strikes. To read the horrific testimonies of survivors. 

The world has to know the truth. You have to know the truth. Spread the word to bring Russia to justice for everything it committed.

تجتاز أعمال وحشية تقوم بها روسيا خط الشر حتى أثناء الحرب،  ولن تنساها ولن تسامحها لا أوكرانيا ولا العالم. لغرض توثيق كل جريمة، تم إطلاق أرشيف خاص لجرائم الحرب الروسية في أوكرانيا على الموقع الرسمي لأوكرانيا https://war.ukraine.ua/russia-war-crimes/ 
على الموقع، اطلع على الخبرة التي عاشها الأوكرانيون لأكثر من ستة أسابيع.  استمع الى أصوات صفارات الإنذار والطائرات الحربية والصواريخ. إقرأ الشهادات المروعة للناجين. عليك أن تعرف الحقيقة. انشرها لتقديم روسيا إلى العدالة على كل ما ارتكبته.

Tindak kekejaman tentara rusia terlampau jahat, bahkan saat perang sekali pun. Sekarang, setiap kejahatan perang Rusia di Ukraina didokumentasikan di situs resmi Ukraina — https://war.ukraine.ua/russia-war-crimes/
Di situs tersebut, Anda dapat menyaksikan sebagian kecil dari bagaimana rakyat Ukraina harus bertahan hidup selama lebih dari enam minggu. Bagaimana rasanya mendengar suara sirene serangan udara, pesawat tempur, dan serangan rudal. Bagaimana rasanya membaca kesaksian-kesaksian yang mengerikan dari mereka yang berhasil selamat.
Seluruh dunia harus tau kebenarannya. Anda harus tau kebenarannya. Sebarkan informasi ini agar rusia diadili atas semua yang telah mereka lakukan.
