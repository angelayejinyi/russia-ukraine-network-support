 🇺🇦 Ukraine - Crisis Relief - https://crisisrelief.un.org/t/ukraine The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund is one of the UN's country-based pooled funds. Contributions are collected into a single, unearmarked fund and managed locally under UN leadership. As crises evolve, funds are made directly and immediately available to a wide range of partner organizations at the front lines of response. This way, funding reaches the people most in need when they need it.  🇸🇾Syria- Molham Team - https://molhamteam.com/en/until_last_tent#donation-process In 2012, Molham Team was founded by a group of dedicated Syrian university students - young men and women who sensed the suffering of fellow Syrians who became refugees in neighboring countries; namely Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Using every resource available to them, the volunteers have been striving to secure necessities, such as food, shelter, and medication for Syrians in need.  🇵🇸 Palestine - Children’s Relief Fund - https://www.pcrf.net/ The Palestine Children's Relief Fund was established in 1992 by concerned humanitarians in the USA to bring injured and sick children for free medical care they could not get locally.  Since then, PCRF has sent over 2,000 sick and injured children for free medical care, as well as sponsored hundreds of volunteer medical teams from all over the world to treat tens of thousands of sick and injured youths in local hospitals. PCRF also has built two pediatric cancer departments in Palestine and has several more major programs and projects taking place to help support the development of a sustainable healthcare system there.",https://www.instagram.com/p/CaabZEKMYgv/,https://crisisrelief.un.org/t/ukraine,crisisrelief.un.org,un

While Ukraine is not a part of the Balkans, I felt obliged to post this. To convey the beauty and individuality of Ukrainian culture. Ukrainians have their own specific culture, language, and history and THIS cannot be erased regardless of what any nationalist say or do. 

Your south-eastern european neighbours in the Balkans are with you Ukraine! The world must hold Russia accountable for what they are doing. This behaviour is UNACCEPTABLE!

Farewell, my wistful Saigon bride 
I'm going out to stem the tide 
A tide that never saw the seas 
It flows through jungles, 'round the trees 
Some say it's yellow, some say red 
It will not matter when we're dead

How many dead men will it take 
To build a dike that will not break? 
How many children must we kill 
Before we make the waves stand still? 

Men die to build their Pharaoh's tombs 
And still, and still the teeming wombs
How many men to conquer Mars?
How many dead to reach the stars?

Ukrainian farmers harvested in 2021-22 around 33 million MT of wheat and just in the region of Kyiv 522.5 million eggs were produced last year. In terms of sunflowers seeds and oil Ukraine is one of the top exporters too. 

Due to the current situation wheat production and exports on all goods have stopped. Many people around the world will be affected. Probably us too.

What is happening in Ukraine affects us all. Join us in prayer and if you can please donate.

My team did an outstanding job while I sat in solidarity with the most beautiful women from Ukraine to ask how can we help. 💙💛

This is not something anyone has dealt with before , but the coming together has been powerful and jobs have been drawn up and people are working now on actions to support, raise funds, make accommodation lists, get donations and volunteers to Kasia and her team at the donation drop off 💛 @smakoteka_galway and @photopapilio 

We raised close to €4,000 today and I want to thank you all for coming in, people were climbing the stairs all day some not even seeking pancakes but just to drop up money. 💛

The UN are expecting up to 4 million Ukrainians to seek refuge in the coming days. 

In the words of Filippo Grandi today who said in his 40 years has never seen numbers like this - 

“It has never been as urgent 
If you fail 
If we fail 
It might be too late for us all”

Art for Ukraine 🇺🇦💙💛

It's hard to create surreal art when the world has become a surreal place, war in Europe only 8 hours drive from Prague where I live and work. 

""Together we are Strong""
I've decided to release a special edition print to bring in money for helping Ukraine. Each print is 800 euros and 100% of the price will be donated to ""Ukraine Humanitarian Fund""
 ( https://crisisrelief.un.org/t/ukraine ) 

This print is sold out in both Medium and Large size so it's a unique opportunity. The size is slightly smaller than the medium print and is printed on Museum Natural Silk 300 paper, 58 x 46 cm ( 22.8 x 18.1 inches ). Shipped rolled in a protective tube. Price includes worldwide shipping. Proof of donation will be posted here on Instagram.
