Speak, stand and spread awareness for those that can’t 💔 It’s very important for us to say something and not ignore what is going on even if it’s half way across the world. It’s our due diligence as humans to acknowledge what’s happening. Hope this nightmare, chaos and senseless cowardliness ends soon.
