I stand with Ukraine! 🇺🇦

I can't stay away from what is happening in Ukraine.
In these last few weeks, I have been following the news to the minute and the violent actions of Russia against Ukraine are impossible to forgive.

I believe that no country and nationality in the world should be in a war conflict. We must unite and strive for peace because together we are stronger. The Ukrainian people have repeatedly proved this to us.

We must do whatever we can to help Ukraine.
For democracy, freedom, and the whole global world order.

Take action, spread accurate information, and help!

Help however you can and don't shut down, don't stay quiet and silent.

Message from PeaceCommunicators - with the support of IFM-SEI Presidium

We here at the international seminar, PeaceCommunicators are working for Peace Education and to end violence. We are devastated by the recent invasion of Ukraine and the start of a war.

We call for international solidarity for those affected by the conflict, both those who are in danger from military violence and those whose safety is at risk while protesting and speaking up.

We condemn these attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty and democracy. We recognise that these actions are a threat to peace everywhere. ...

We stand for peace everywhere and against violence and oppression anywhere.

We send love and solidarity to all those affected by the hostilities.

What can you do:

SOCIAL MEDIA → Use #westandwithukraine in your social media posts and amplify the voices involved in and protesting against the invasion and expose the violations against Children’s Rights.

EDUCATE → Educate yourself about the situation and the impact of violence on Human Rights and Children’s Rights.

ADVOCATE → Get in touch with your representatives and encourage them to call for non-violence and a peaceful resolution of the conflict, and support anti-occupation legislation.

DONATE → If you have the means to show financial solidarity, make sure you are donating to those directly impacted.

Art loses its meaning when bombs are falling from the sky. When there is war, you face great evil and it is difficult to be peaceful and humble.
I believe a generation will be born that will never see WAR again!

Sadly, children in Eastern Ukraine have grown up in conflict for the past eight years, enduring violence, shelling and being displaced from their homes. Today, fighting in Ukraine has forced children and families to seek refuge in neighboring countries, with more than 3 million people having now crossed the borders.
Ukraine’s children are caught in the crossfire of this war. 
@SavetheChildren has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. Your donation to the Children's Emergency Fund can help provide children and families impacted by the conflict in Ukraine with immediate aid, such as food, water, hygiene kits, psychosocial support and cash assistance.

We do not have any students from the impacted regions on our program. We’re of course continuing to closely monitor the situation.⁠
⁠
With our focus on working with youth to enable them to discover themselves and evolve, we are extremely heartbroken to see what the children of Ukraine are going through. We’re now joining the world in support of Ukraine through Save the Children, donating an amount equivalent to a full-year high school exchange. ⁠
⁠
Everyone, everywhere, should have an unequivocal right to peace, safety, and freedom. Let’s all pray for a soon end to this atrocious situation.⁠
⁠
Please join us in supporting Save the Children. They are actively helping children both in Ukraine, along the borders, and in the receiving countries.⁠

We have Ukrainian members within our community, members with family in Ukraine, as well as team members who are in border countries witnessing the incredible humanitarian efforts taking place.

What’s happening is utterly heartbreaking and it goes without saying that we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and hope for a peaceful resolution as soon as possible.

As a supportive and compassionate community, we know many of us want to know how we can do more and offer our support.

As a business community, it’s unimaginable to not only have your life turned upside down, but to also have your livelihood and business that you have worked so hard to build disrupted as well. 

We know just how much heart and soul goes into all the amazing women-owned businesses around the world, which is why we wanted to share ways that we can all directly support Ukrainian businesses, and the women behind those businesses, at this time. 

Here are a few businesses through which you can support Ukrainian entrepreneurs: 

• Support Sellers in Ukraine (Etsy page, digital sellers)
• HappySpacesWorkshop
• Artliciousness
• MisTeryPlace
• CalligraphyByAnnY
• VividStitchShop
• StitchyPrincess
• Drawiind
• DigitalNastasiaArt
• AirBnB 

(URLs are all shared in our latest blog post, see our recent IG Story for the direct link)

As well as supporting businesses, if you’re in a position to donate, these are a few charities providing humanitarian relief:

• Red Cross (https://help.rescue-uk.org/ukraine-crisis)
• Disaster Emergency Appeal (https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal) 
• Save the Children (https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/how-you-can-help/emergencies/ukraine-appeal)
• Choose Love (https://donate.chooselove.org/campaigns/ukraine-appeal) 
• The Pachamama Project (https://www.thepachamamaproject.org/index.html#welcome) – period poverty in war

It’s a scary time and our hearts are with all those suffering, but together we can all play a small part in supporting the people of Ukraine.
