‚ÄúLove yourself, love others, love the world‚Äù this is our mantra at @getlovedup 

In our current times it has never been more important to show some love to our suffering world, more precisely the country that‚Äôs under attack, the Ukraine. It is easy to get caught up in the fear and darkness humankind is experiencing and feel heartbroken and helpless, however it is important for us to not let that outshine the love that is happening and how we can support the people of Ukraine in this moment.‚ú®

To shift the energy towards hope and healing vs fear, I want to outline some amazing initiatives that show the love that is still in humanity:

1. People all over the world have been booking Airbnb homes and shopping from Etsy artisans to help Ukrainian locals.

2. The people of Russia have been protesting against the war with the risk of going to prison.

3. People from neighboring countries have opened their boarders to receive those fleeing from the fight 

The Care initiative: I‚Äôm so grateful to have a platform to reach many people, as it‚Äôs in these difficult moments that my purpose becomes even more present, to raise the vibration of the world and support collective love consciousness. I have linked the Care initiative in my bio to support their immediate crisis and reach millions of Ukrainians with emergency aid. To donate to this fundraiser just clink link or spread the word. Discover more here: https://www.care.org

An affirmation to pray for Ukraine:

I pray for every person on this earth‚Äôs right for justice, equity, and equality. 

If you know of any ways to continue supporting the Ukrainian community, please feel free to share them below so we can spread the love in the world.‚ú®",https://www.instagram.com/p/CaxHprTFBym/,https://www.care.org,www.care.org,care

A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in Ukraine as attacks of war put millions of lives at risk. Innocent families, women and girls, and the elderly will suffer as much as those on the front lines of fighting. CARE‚Äôs Ukraine Crisis Fund aims to reach those groups with immediate aid and recovery, food, water, hygiene kits, psychosocial support and cash assistance. 

During the Week of Caring, the Town of West Springfield and Agawam encourage residents to support these vulnerable populations through donations to the Ukraine Crisis Fund. Donations can be made online anytime during the Week of Caring by going to CARE'S website (linked below). Residents may also stop by the West Springfield Senior Center on Saturday, March 26 between 9am-1pm to donate. Cash and checks will be taken during that time.
