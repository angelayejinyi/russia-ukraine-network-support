 I, together with girls from other countries, want to tell you about the fact that you and I have the opportunity to help my country from any corner of the world to help my beloved Ukraine in such a difficult situation. 

Every day Ukraine is attacked and bombarded by the Russian army.  Thousands of innocent civilians have lost their lives, lost their homes and over a million have already fled the country.  Europe is experiencing the largest humanitarian crisis in history.  While there are many charities and volunteers helping out right now, we still need your help. 
  My friends and I have already sent help, but our resources are limited.  I cooperate with Ukrainian associations and know exactly what is needed, where to buy and how to send. 
  Here is a list of what the collected money will be spent on: -children's clothes and shoes, diapers, wet wipes, baby food; - groceries, canned food; - medicines; - Blankets, pillows and other urgent need

Please, keep in mind that this source trustworthy, all the money will be used only for Ukrainians in need
